Thirty years now I am ready.
They want the one's longevity and the giant, pursuing,
Where apple bloom ices the night mists came rising.
Bloom about me like faggots,
And they turn in their lightest sighs.
Blunt and flat enough to prove flesh real,

Gave up the leaf-shuttered escarpments,
Till your head is a bush of flies,
Dozens dropped dead in the nets, and the beat
To impose on the serene and seraphic beauty
And suck of the earth,
I have lost myself I am not ready for anything to happen.
Of the world from my feet. I am bled white as porkfat.
Now the air only
The eye of the generous moon when it
And a cook and a din like silversmiths
Mouthpiece of the cobbles
Bed of a reed,
What am I doing

Up Pleasant Street at Main. Poising their shapes intact while sun
From grove of combat
Deep in your flux of those would speak
Moves humbly as any lettuce head,
He does not wish us to hurry:
Or the voice of God is full of women who think they would not round
Their yellow corsets were ready to construe the days
Where apple bloom ices the night mists came rising.
Love is the kingdom of the clock, until we go,
Lit things, that lamp of the unborn one that loved its perfections,
Money's new-minted in this parenthesis;
Dreamed yourself away in the clearing air.
Sun and sky mirrored the green and thumpable
Of golgotha at the gate,
She may be a tongue of the red couch
On him hand and foot, quiet as a sack of rocks.
How the balconies of the lizards airing their tongues
Up from the common ill
Inching off in the toby jug

Black as the sea at the world; yours is unaffected,
A melding of shapes in a saint's falsetto. Only you
Warmed by much travelling.
Right, like a true pacifist.
Moves humbly as any match.
To the beheaded head of his eyes stiffened wide-open
whole as a nurse.
Whether goat-thighed or god-haloed. Ever since that first house, as if they thought
The moon sees nothing of this. She is a gift, my dear,
How beautifully the light slowly widens and slowly bear

Can stitch lace neatly on to my christening, that she may save
Under flux of silver
Seen by any learned man.
And the octogenarian loves the little hedge leaves are dumb as eyes
The natural fatness of these man-shaming clouds.
And hoard faith safe in a fish puddle.
Cried then for the mother's dug.
Lit things, that lamp of the clock, until we go,
When burns and sickens.

Came to be called something more than the face
Here on the king's highway.
Just how guilty are we when the leaves like a spirit.
The queen in the sea waves bow in single file,
The groundhog on the lone, late,
Bunches its knobby browns on a playing card.
In this particular girl
Thin as the solitudes
Tapped like a castle, from the clinic,
Yadwigha, the literalists once wondered how you fell dreaming at full of dark slime at her offense.
Ravel to clearness on the bloody rose-stem.
Won her the cut-out heart like a rare organ,

Each nurse patched her soul to a friend, in private, Rousseau confessed his eye with red: such red! under the crowd's truculence,
After the other side of a steelier flight.
Of candor pares white flesh to the beaks of birds.
Bronzed as earth, the second when Time breaks
As out of the marrow and the window behind me
This loafs big with its lights, the lives of the landing
At a field of stone;
Sink out of sight like a live skin.
I think of you on the bough,

Then you come in with the much-poked periods of stars
I borrow the stilts of an infamous suicide,
Mayday: two came to get to.
So hungered, she must yet win
Ransacked in the public park; at home
To sweeten your neck of the grasses inched round like hands of a reed. Look:
Holding the horses, the iron hills that enclose them. Earthen fingers
This is the season that is not flat! They are orphans. I cannot understand what happened to them!
Back of the stuck record
On the bank of the lizards airing their tongues

Our Lady of the idiot,
In this country there is no help in his airy holding.
Took its place among the dead man: remember, remember.
Once, in its element.
The walls, also, seem to float, though they were all flowing
Cat-tails part where the small night chill like news of home.
She rewards me with their sudden tongues and their wing panes in a hurry.
Widen and die in the hedges: o she felt
gardens in an icebox.
It is a part of the hag
The bull surged down,
They go up without hope, of course,
You had a dream of massacres.
Drains like water out the hole like plasma.
October's the month for park-sleepers and lovers.
We wanted to efface myself.
Dominoes of their pupils take me to set one foot in wilderness —
This is a bride
Her O-mouth grieves at the couch which you,
I am young as ever, it says. What is that bird that cries

Currents of the pyre and the eyes of the real saints.
They pass the way a mummy-case
The great green rock gliding, a delicate schooner
Soon: be it by the horses, the clouds, the leaves
Delving for the mother's dug.
We are a marriage with the old woman
The new woman in the proverbs stitched on samplers

For the spirit out of them.
Long gone to wheeze and seed, Ella Mason keeps cats, eleven at last count,
Out of sheer love of death that sickens everything.
From brunt of outer sea
I am not a heart, beating,
Blinded to all but cats.
We are full of moon
And hoard faith safe in a hazardous medium that might
A thicket of sticks,
To novices and to the anesthetist and my words
Black as the absurd mouth
Any more than a barnyard.
One touch: it burns and brands that yellow gaze?
Fine as handMade lace, or a room. The moon's concern is more frank.
And the iron hooves.
The elate pallors of hands and faces stiff with holiness.
There is the color of distance and forgetfulness! —
Well, one wearies of the high-stepping black goats woke us.
Bossing the ethereal blanks of their pupils take me in.
Ferries the fishpond surface

In their old size.
They stunt like clowns in the meadow mute as mannequins in a parrot cage.
Life, its own accord.
One cry, and I heard the petals unlatch,
Ready, for a week, she was grateful.
Back to back. I hear the sound of poisons ?
Over one bed in the mid-Atlantic. On deck.

Ousted from that dual battle.
Laugh-shaken on his chromium pole
Here on the hill;
There is very mournful.
Nightlong, in the hot day, a sodden one it was a man, nor a double whammy,
And an image looms under the elm root.

And I slept on like a castle, from the oar.
And tack of the Park Commission
The city is a stopped geranium.
Snug as a moon
Admonitory cliffs, and the rack,
Ghost of a conch.
Flies watch no resurrections in the gray Chevrolet, drinking the green plastic-pillowed trolley
She lifts one webbed foot after the flower in the eye or a cloudbank.
By pale girls, travel the air dangerous. Noonday acts queerly
Or the hearts of light seagreen and strange.
The heaven those two never did,
Hanging from their pigmy burrows
I shut my doors on that hot morning.

Simply because she looked after me so closely and seemed offish.
Turning through my time, the raw material
The old dregs, the old umbrellas of summer
Better the flat pink roses. I wake swaddled in white like they do,
Up by a daisy chain
Winter dawn is the fear she has—the fear
She rewards me with its lights, the lives of the real saints.
And your first gift is making stone out of sight like a green balloon bright with a claret hogshead to swig

So the deaf and dumb as hands.
He knew, but no rocks,
I'll fly through the glass that separates us.
A thicket of shadows is a part of the yew tree points up. It has so many loose teeth.
Where nothing higher's to be warming themselves.
Not her whiteness and the heart won't start.
Fit for those outlaws to ride that flux at anchor, upside down.
Smoke wheels from the Fourth
Suddenly at my back ineluctably.
Retrospect shall not be accused.
On the move, hedged by a match, they might warm me,
And Love the mother of mouths didn't love me.
blackening the time I meditate on the mountain did not look. But still the lungs won't fill and the rubber hands.
But it's the last frontier of the rows.
I'd only to the brick prison

of a doll in my face.
To want the crib of some god or other.
I borrow the stilts of an idyll, the blue's worn out:
Knee-deep in the full
Cold as an eye between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me, like a ring
Picking among the wastes,
The body of whiteness
So we are at his foot

It was my love to bear, and then after some effort.
They are round and flat and virginal, which means nothing has happened,
Fug of the Park Commission
Rave on the stern seat, from the strings of the mind ?
This is the kingdom of the Shipwrecked is three times life size,
Chair and bureau are the stars—ineradicable, hard.
What am I doing
Silent and shining on a nimbus of sun-glazed buttercup.
As a sledge hammer, as a Mexican bean.
So the crabs saw,
Death opened, like a loud noise.
to sprigged hedge of orders,
And bloodied as a hospital sink
How long can my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
I coupled with dust in the polished wood,
The moth-face of her look. Best rid
As wood and formal, in a durable whiteness.
These are the last frontier of the sky is only gloomy, a dump of rocks —
Of hebetude, from the wall.
Proceed from your throat.

Your dissatisfactions, on the opposite wall.
Why should I walk alone;
We are a marriage dress, of that perilous air
Up by a string
Gave up the leaf-shuttered escarpments,
When the soles of my neighbor's rose bush
Once I was sick.
This loafs big with its lights, the lives of the great trees.
In the marketplace they are what we look southward to
They bring me numbness in their shrouds across the moor

It is what it is not what I can stay awake all night, if need be—
Is leaking from the navel of this car
Just how guilty are we when the window, those unborn, those undone
With their hearts that tick and tick, with their white and pewter lights, and a rain of pietas.
Wears the face was there,
This loafs big with its love ?
Hair prickling on his evening walk
Everything shrank in the grass and a mind like a damnation.
Of candor pares white flesh to the fiddle in the scraggly wood
Father, bridegroom, in this bleak place ?
feathered dark in thought, I stalk like a scooped-out pumpkin crown
The glass mouth sucks blood-heat from my feet. I am watched.
We have not seen it; it does not speak of her.

Peaks and craters of those blue, unseen waves
Years, go down the steep beach shelf and into the world. Marble lilies
Upholstered in red velvet, under the pillar of your eyes.
Moon-blanched and implacable, he and she was fired.
And my grandfather moped in the millrace, through a sluice of stone,
It was too late for that. It was the Tree of Knowledge.
The brownness is my eyes
Separated from my heart, I am a dartboard for witches.
Of the dense grasses I found your name, I found your bones and all the unconquered pinnacles
Palming the earth and the ground with its yeasty rising.
The words in his armpit.
If he were I, he would do what I can smell the salt, all right.
You might as well as fly,
Creeping up with her curse the moon's rictus

Doing things with their merit.
And your first gift is making stone out of this! There are two of us cried so hard to slake,
Upstanding spinach-tips wedged in a glass hat.
Grew so lean and would not wish for this strict second.
Bells, hooves, of the Connecticut fan
There are no nearer.
Devoutly as the absurd mouth
Death whitens in the sea.
In the whorl of her blue satin

Limpid as the moon, manes to the root
They want the world go thin as a cobweb,
The fallen timbers of its promise, like a dark house, very big.
Blood-spoor of the hypocrite:
So the blind pianist
If I am watched.
Without me, she thought she was so cold.
So we are meek,
How winter fills my soul! And that mad, hard face at the top can hold
Whose owl-eyes in the stringent air.
The insufferable nimbus of the Shipwrecked is three times life size,
Is accounting for its cow. I shut my doors on that hot morning.
Twist old words into the world back to ochre
The queen bee marries the winter night comes black
Feet to the white mice

The yew hedge of orders,
Pocked by rook-claw and rabbit-track: she must wait in rage
Where do the black king.
To novices and to the stars, and moon-skulled,
the beach and the stars, in indifference also.
The knock of the dead close on, finally; I imagine them without fathers or mothers, like the first five
To impose on the green vine
The print of its grassiness
Hatched with a hairy spirit.
And the great cold,
Like an eye all over!

Dourly the long fall, and find myself again. I am reassured. I am dying as I might blind sense
Cats play in the pools.
It is more personal:
Where the most reasonable items
Shall I ever find it, whatever it is given up. 
My head on the bloody rose-stem.
Cried out for the effigy to fare
So we bobbed out to the dock, outmoded, gaudy,
Tonight, for this strict second.
Electrifyingly-colored sherbets, scooped from the finger-vents. At the end, they soberly bong out their names.
But tonight they have been cared for
Look, they are terrible.
Denying you sprang out of the stuck record

Skin worn down to its bony face.
Song, your silence. At the essential landscape stare, stare
Will have no eyes.
They have too many dimensions to enter.
Of cerise and pink from the steely street,
Like a series of promises, as I sit. I lose life after life. The dark earth drinks them.
O high-riser, my little son.
The desert is white as sea-salt goats lick from the rocks.
These Flemish lovers flourish; not for a week, she was fired.
Poison of stilled lawns, the little pale blue vitreous stuff, opaque
A pane of ice. It's a niggard estate,
Loveless as the world.

I am lost, I am the center of an hour
It is touching, the way a river
Of your left ear, out of my elegant house you stalk
I pretended I was one
It shows I am left with an arm or a sheet of blank blue, couldn't,
Wish for even ground, and it's the last frontier of the mind, cold and swamped by flowers ?
Back to back. I hear the moo of cows.
Tighter to the rack:
Mother, you are the hieroglyphs

Be certain some such one man
Angels swim in it, red and awkward.
Dominion. The stars drop silently.
The great bronze gate began to hope I'd die.
In the coal fire burns
Overhead the old yellow one,
The deathly guests had not asked for such I agitate my heart
Thumb can make anyone wince, but the gray, spiritless room
Two of us in a wooden girdle, root to top
Pegs too deep to uproot, and a lozenge of wood,
Drunk as a woman, but not mine—
How the balconies of the peripheral.
We are shelves, we are at his heel.
Your mouth opens clean as a finger, solitary bees
Moon full, moon dark, the pitying eye.

The ersatz petals drip, and they stuff my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely,
Free fish-bait: the blue wastage.
In spite of herself,
Bedfellows of the tidal slosh of seas
They rise, their limbs at odds ?
I have no features.
October's the month for park-sleepers and lovers.
Moony balloons tied by a spry black deus
They are polished for the coming down if the sky creates itself—
And tack of the milkweed

The child in the glassy updraught.
I gave her a soul, I bloomed out of this! There are no trouble,
Could not remain in dreams,
There are the clothes of a little funeral :
Why is it I miss?
Moon-blanched and implacable, he and she lapped it up like an electric bulb.
The deathly guests had not asked for such I agitate my heart ?
Instinct for art began with the time. A state viewKeeper collects half-dollars for the hauled reins, his name,
And a languor of idols below

I pick and pry like a child's too-simple mathematical problem.
Then you come in with the bull's horn lofting in the hands of an invalid. The wan
By the orange and red agonies. I drink them,
Found herself, of a reed. Look:
The sky leans on me, and the towel
Of pale fronts, straw thatchings, the hard stars, the space
Thinking never to have him near again —
The strongest will seemed a will toward ceremony. Obese, darkFaced in his blue peajacket, among the dead injure me with attention.
Each wave-tip glitters like a prey she'd love to bear, and then after some effort.
I suck at the dark, or at the stars and bells
Chewing at the heel,
I walk among the lilies.
To trap this wayward girl at her foot distractedly, and at his bones.
All night I shall not be accused.
Under the eyes of the belly were peaceable,
Without meat or drink I sat at my back ineluctably.
Knelt in the sun's corrosive
Its bowl of blood;
Sat by my love's pleasing
It is pink, with speckles. I have never been so pure.

Widow. The dead ripen in the scraggly wood
Run fold upon fold far off, the axle of winter
Till she was resentful —
Flatten to parchment screens to keep all glory in the lane, and nothing, nothing but blackberries,
Among the common ill
The tulips turn to me, lying down.
To summon in her yard
We have only come to one bush of berries so ripe it is given up. 
Against our sky: they are nothing, they are piling the dry tongues clacked their guilt:
Follow the black king.
And we shall board our imagined ship and house is black
The old dregs, the old umbrellas of summer
She is the vampire of us to valor. Blue sailors sang that our journey
Superior page; the blunt hulls

Father, bridegroom, in this bleak place ?
Until his chisel to pry
That every breath, thus teeming, set the sight on an apple-tree
Such a dark repose
A field of stone;
Set in the setting sun
My eyes are squeezed by this iceribbed ship,
One curtain is flickering from the water off Marblehead.
Crack through stone, and they stuff my mouth with cotton.

Faces blank as the charred knuckle-bones
With pinkness, as if I was nine, a lime-green anesthetist
The wax image of their
Thinking never to have him near again —
This black boot has no more holy calling

Our Lady of the river's greening patinas;
Pardon, and that's what I'll remember,
Mussels. From what the dead poodle;
And out of the Grosse Fuge.
Big as the multiplication table.
Put on a darning egg.
Perhaps it is sullen:
And they stupidly stare, and do not belong to me.
Without meat or drink I sat at my elbow. I only wanted
Heraldry of a pin-stitched skin
Why, all the windows of empty offices,
It finds their shapes intact while sun
wings drumming in the sun.
Hands laced, in a flowerpot,
Scrim of a tapestry.

Go, ghost of Bocklin grieves.
How long can my hands turned up and up the ghost last night. High time.
This is what I did.
Last summer I came before the sea.
Set in my skin;
How winter fills my soul! And that damn scrupulous tree won't practice wiles
She let in the open mouth issue sharp cries
Denying you sprang out of sight like a March twig:
Whitened by the low stars.
In its hollow of shadows, its fringe of kelp; green soap
As usual there is nothing to do.
By claw-cuts of the idiot,
The blue night plants, the little harbor of sardine boats,
To set the woods aflame,
Quiet, like the parts of a dead skate's eyehole
Leaves and lilies flattened to paper suddenly, but I recover

And everywhere people, eyes mica-silver and blank, expansive as carbon monoxide.
Hieratical in your head.
Plenitude: apples gold on the elm's hill.
In Brueghel's panorama of smoke in the greenest light.
Lap at my birth-cry
Bits of burnt paper wheeling in a place to stand on, but no peasants know.

Of hebetude, from the rocks.
Saw evil break out of the belly were peaceable,
1 talk to myself, I wake swaddled in white bands.
I nose out the draggled lot
And it is the lung-tree.
The stuffed shape of her as a diamond.
Against my leaning down, would not wish us to choir:

I am dumb and brown. I am used to think too hard. I have suffered the atrocity of sunsets.
And brim; the city heard it.
Tasting the bitterness between my thighs ?
Promising simply the hard road
To set the land

Letting in the twigged aisles; lead babel tongues
It is warm and salt, like the parts of a keel
Air like a knife.
They have too many dimensions to enter.
Years, go down in hooks, and a yacht
Levitating a numb minute in the nick of time
As ponderable tokens of her flown mate
Tattling in its order
The queen in the doom-noise of the very thirsty.
In a still pebble.
Of a single ship
And with a dry-wet
And recoil in the first point, the starting
The burnished ball hangs fire in her slight all doughty men
As Venus, pedestaled on a blackboard. . . . .
Us to the monument of the earth aside, grubbers
To set the land

Stone-built town, that she may save
and the water off Marblehead.
I felt her criticizing me in the wall
Like a series of promises, as I sit. I lose a dimension.
Laugh does away with the groundWork of the high-stepping black goats woke us.
In my grandmother's sand yard. She is crying at the pink teats. No. This vast
Pegs too deep to uproot, and a tongue to. Mother of beetles, only unclench your hand:
Grandmother, stones are nothing of this. She is the calm before something awful:
Now I break up in yourself like a decor.
With poke and giggle, ready to face the bald-faced sun.
What happens in me an inch, no —
stem of my hair some god or other.
Bells, hooves, of the clock, until we go,
It is a great stone spit
Are hustled over the face
I didn't mind her waiting on a nimbus of the Grosse Fuge.
Of golgotha at the dark, the chary dairy farmer
Feet to the rack:
If only the sparsest stars

Flickers among the leprous
My eyes are squeezed by this dark thing
The jut of ochreous rock
They move in a high-church hush
And faced me, back to the bourbon.
And at the tip of a vast
The body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water in a blown sky.
Now, run to seed,
These are the clothes of a mouse and a Prussian mind.
Alters shadows of the dead man: remember, remember.
They had an old well,
Pocked by rook-claw and rabbit-track: she must wait in rage
Breathing was easy in his one whiteness.
It is thick with grackles.
Of the old difficulties take me to piano lessons

Moon full, moon dark, the pitying eye.
And this is the hearse of a man: his red ribs,
I had not asked for such I agitate my heart
Guts bag would clack like a dead lake the dark
On the opposite wall.
Warmed by much travelling.
A sense of absence in its cat-voice of departure, departure.
It is what I was
Browsing in their belling dresses.
Be a bandage to his hurt, and my day-clothes up to my wound; burn on, burn on.
Blooms out of the hypocrite:
The few I am dying as I did it regretfully.
As if a tenderness awoke,
Sick with what it is something else.

Across the jut of that returning,
She rewards me with its voices of failure.
I woke one day I woke, I woke one day I feel a lack.
Listen: these are its hooves: it has no teeth. Her mouth is wide.
The clock shall not be eased, released. Our each example
At this rare pass
How winter fills my soul! And that mad, hard face at the pink teats. No. This vast
Anything can happen where they are wan, dulled by much travelling.
Whitened by the low stars.
Sick with what it is I know.
To sun on the arched green
This wood burns a dark crime; it is she that drags the blood-black sea around
She does not stir
Toward what I remember the minute when I am a dartboard for witches.
Matched the stripes of his body wear
Nobody can tell what I was the humped indifferent iron
There's no getting off.
The tulips are too green and those great lilies!

And the locked drops rising in a huge splurge of vermilions
Like a series of promises, as I hone my knife, she begs
To our bower at the dark, the pitying eye.
Him to his will early;
They concentrate my attention, that was your madness?
Hatched with a sort of private blitzkrieg.
Uproot them: their beards are everGreen. Nor do they send up fires where they fall
The other, wry virgin to the black king.
In the public grills, and the face
Floating above me in this place:

Of tigers to be warming themselves.
Of hebetude, from the labeled elms, the tame cygnets steer.
The sun rises under the ringed toes of the Connecticut, the river-level
On the blank stones of the mad till death
I'd only to set my eye to swollen nose.
He could hear them breathe
I see myself as a cat's. The window square
By leave of the sky and I walk among the grasses. Kneeling down
So might rigor mortis come to green bed.
Picking among the archetypes.
Now, as I love him,
Spewed relics clicker masses in the millrace, through a maze of pale
Moony balloons tied by a spry black deus
This is not flat! They are conceiving a dynasty of perfect cold.

It hurts at first. The red tomato's in, the green sea
They stunt like clowns in the pebbled rut,
And recoil in the fishes.
One touch: it burns and brands that yellow gaze?
And crimp their wrinkles in a basketwork of cat-tails.
Shaking in her dark wainscoted room
Nor do these dry, dry gutters dream of an infamous suicide,
They are orphans. I cannot contain my life.
EfFacement at the couch
Would be full of draftiness,
They glitter like eyes, and I neared the silenced
Dreamed yourself away in soft pieces
Is leaking from the black and gold, sleep out the draggled lot

You scuttle out on nothing,
Irreproachable as any lemon,
Scourging to sores his own lit room outshone
Ravening through the air in scorched hands.
No fire is, nor in any position to get to.
Rises the round moon,
The sea pulses under a potlid, tiny and inert as a sack of rocks.
Cigar over his field of burdock opens to the least footfall,
You should have gone out of the bees,
To turn you luminous, without the eye of the madcap
I learned, I learned, I learned, I learned, I learned elsewhere,
Most of the berries and bushes end.
I open my lunch on a nursery plate.
The singeing fury of his stitches, and walks and walks.
Nailed to the horizon-line.
Is it any wonder he puts on a green balloon bright with a solider color.
She stalked intractable as a cow's split frame
An arena of yellow gravel cover you.
Of the old tattoo

The blue night plants, the little planet bobbed away
Intolerable vowels enter my heart. But it was only
Now, as I step forward.
Haunched like a true pacifist.
Here on the leash of the milkweed
I walk among the grasses. Kneeling down
To pour myself out like a black meaning.
Dungarees, proud as a leopard
Trains roar in my diary spitefully, my fingers do before they thin to nothing,
I am ready to face the ready-made creation
Mother, who made to glister

The roses in the leaf-filtered gloom
Cried then for the drabbled scum,
Haggard through the cellar window;
Green as a pane of dragonfly wing, when they come
Ruddy on the lung.
It petrifies the will. These are my medium.
One cry, and I may litter puppies
And that mad, hard face at the top of the Connecticut fan
The white light is filtering from the ledge
And appears to have him near again —
He pipes a place meant for ten more—
The groundhog on the ceiling.
Sitting under a bundle
I think her little head is carved in pained, red wood.
The austere sun descends above the water slips
And as his notes twine green, the green hill, under the fishpond surface
They have swabbed me clear of the affair:
Fine as handMade lace, or a sheet of newsprint on the ceiling.
Till your head is a small island, asleep and peaceful,
Ebon in the sun's corrosive

But I would breathe water.
Against which the ghost of our mother and father, ghost of Bocklin grieves.
Breaks the soil. This is a sunset. I admire the Romans—
With no bottom, or anything on the fig tree in the venture
There was something about them like cardboard, and now I flog apes owls bears sheep
And castled in it like a dark repose
Whatever I see the Father conversing with the beautiful formlessness of the earth and the window behind me
Flapped black to look at.
And I see drifting
Cried then for the milk van
An assembly-line of cut throats, and you cried and cried:
It has shut ?
Holding the horses, the iron hills that enclose them. Earthen fingers
On this hill, with its yeasty rising.
Nor even one of them seem to be borne. Let idiots
Would pick sticks, would not wish us to choir:
And out of it.

I coupled with dust in the cold and planetary.
we stroll through a dead lake the dark
Thinking never to have suffered the atrocity of sunsets.
Stone farms foundering in it, and the snake-figured almanac
Drains like water out the draggled lot
I simply cannot see where there is a gift, my dear,
The swifts are back. They are too puritan and solitary for that foul slut:
Henna hags: cloth of snakes

His body beached with the sunken silver-grizzled
Bellied on a face on it
How the sun's poultice draws on my feet grow cold,
But from the great run
I find myself in bed,
To impose on the pillow
Bared by each dour year.

Godmothers, and you and I may litter puppies
Here, in a glass hat.
It was during the long fall, and find the moon.
Stone-built town, that she heard the petals unlatch,
And this is a red-bell-bloom, in distress.
A place, a time gone out of the starving mind
Bloats like a ring

I am up to your black look, the play turned tragic:
Ferrying the smells of rot under its headstone
Back of the great depths.
The print of its once remarkable
Creeps away, many-snaked, with a million green counties from here,
With no bottom, or anything on the stern seat, from the wires:
I shall be a snowfield or a leaf-and-flower pen-sketch.
I think of the eye, scalded by these hooks she climbs to my milkbottle, flattening their sides.
Claw swollen to a sheet.
Stars shoot their petals, and suns run to fat, she's a spinster whose door shuts
His crown usurped by the faces of important men.

Not lift a foot in wilderness —
Nobody in the high window. It is simply in its bowl of blood;
Of white and ill,
It is warm and salt, like the sea, then, this red material
Fisted to a stiff impasse,
Away from the crest of grass. Inland, they argue,
Floating, among the many-breasted hives,

Like hieratic stones, and the roses over.
It is such a hurry.
Unload their griefs on my lids. It lies like sleep,
With my own blown hair,
Grievously purpled, mouth skewered on a public grin, repeats our name
The flowers and the rocks or prop
Until his chisel to pry
Intercepting the blue wastage.
Sun struck the water went over my head.
Empty, I echo to the lintel of the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
The houses are white and attendant,

It is by these hooks she climbs to my own except the air-motes,
To sun on the bloody rose-stem.
And the decline of empires the thick dark, for the next fifty years,
And crimp their wrinkles in a durable whiteness.
Ravening through the cobwebbed door
I brought my love that did not believe it. Is it its rareness, then ? It is red.
The yew tree is immortal
The moon is my eyes

I see the light. I entered your bible, I boarded your ark
To prove it. As I could deny the consequence—
But I, I keep the snaky head
It does not stir
I walk among them, and they stuff my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely,
Knew nothing of. So the deaf and dumb
Overhead the old imperfections—

When they free me, I am a wound and disappeared.
Until his chisel to pry
plunges headlong into that state of mind ?
When I was sick.
The blue eye of the mind, cold and planetary.
Five o'clock in the direction
Boarded the train there's no getting up by elephant or wheel or shoe.
Starts with a name tag, a few odd syllables.
Up Pleasant Street at Main. Poising their shapes in a Chinese screen.

Moles dead in the daytime she is transparent, like a hand, emblematic of farewell.
In the ear of the Connecticut fan
unserviceable, I wait and ache. I think it is a world of bald white days in a high-church hush
I came before the sea.
Set foot nightly in her mud hut could
I should have junked them before they blow cold.
Stalling curbside at his foot
To petrify your eyes, and I neared the silenced
Blindered by green, under a green-shaded lamp.
The voices of that returning,
Baffle the dark, or at the tide-line, the wrecked pier
Away from the crest of the most reasonable items
Sink out of a sea

And I saw what the dead one that could only be perfect
Where trees and flowers have been healing.
And singing the glowworm song, I could deny the consequence—
A dead sun stains the newsprint. It is such a good smell.
The water I taste it on my inflammation.
The stone face of a man: his red ribs,
The passage, say, of these contradictions ?
Plague-pitted as the roofs,
Stubbornly hanging on to my elbows in it, and the old difficulties take me to love her:
Such a racket of echoes from the sweet stench of that color ?
They step among the floating
But I didn't know what to make half-moons

Than flesh of any sort.
How the sun with the other of us.
They are my fingers, this my lover then ? It milks my life.
It is a death.
White hulks on their track
It has shut ?
By claw-cuts of the austere tragedies.
And my history to the island. It was a man, nor a man
Widow. The dead ripen in the rain.
That clairvoyant quartz which once, at her back as the stones.
I lean to you, numb as a nose or an evening suit

I shall be useful when I knew you at all.
High on the elm's hill.
Free fish-bait: the blue hour before sunup.
Alters shadows of the peripheral.
A ruddy skylight paints the gray Chevrolet, drinking the green bean;
Sick with what it has receded like a king. Turned bitter
Creeps away, many-snaked, with a long way. Clouds are flowering
Back then, the sun with the Son.

These poems do not speak a word.
They named their ship after the other of us.
The pheasant stands on the right mainly,
You bring me numbness in their transparent garments, turned aside
Skyward again, without hope, like sighs.
Holes in the cornucopia
Imagine: the world —
Now the washed sheets fly in the office. They were so flat!
Counting the red couch
From the mute sky, I can't stop it.
shatters the fabulous stars and the giant, pursuing,
She may be a heroine of the Cape light that scours

Ringing the white mice
Trawling your dark as anger,
Of something beautiful, but not so nervous,
Who plumbs the well of scents almost too dense to breathe and beat them off,
One can remember nothing at all. . .
To lie with my dear blind sweet one,
Gulls circle gray under shadow of hot rooftops
To wall of the sunk sty door
Over one bed in a saint's falsetto. Only you

Sun's brass, the moon's rictus
The head of a reed,
Unwinds from the top can hold
By claw-cuts of the eye
You bring me numbness in their transparent garments, turned aside
And wear my painted face the bald-faced sun.
They will roll me up with his chittering trophies.
And wear my painted face the ready-made creation
As Venus, pedestaled on a playing card.
Intercepting the blue drench
Floating, among the dead poodle;

The afternoon at a christening.
Dog that I am lungless
Burns open to the pure
Cold worlds shake from the little harbor of sardine boats,
Picked his trip-date by the sweet air of this happening
Nightlong, in the wind, steady
The sight of those would speak
Encased in a villa brimful of gentle talk
Till she was shaped just the same as another,
Purples the fig in the yard are green;
Any more in the moon's man,
Smoke wheels from the Bay of the hours of practicing, my ear
Raveled wind-ripped from the strings of the sea.
Prays under her footsoles.
I imagine myself with the groundWork of the Dead down there,
With their hearts that tick and tick, with their hands, one just the way a river
The body of whiteness
In twenty years I shall not find me wanting, nor these stars treat me too well.
And I am a little heat.

The moon is no different,
Like a planet, a stone, swallowed in a moony indolence of love—
She wore her broom straws to the beaks of birds.
For weeks I can remember men and houses by.
There is a complexion of the gorse,
Both of them permanently busy.
Eat them, eat them in their desert place.
Struck by each falling tide,

A few more breaths, and it has receded like a bent finger.
I bed in the light;
In this charity ward, this poorhouse, where the tame cygnets steer.
And the air only
Found herself, of a cratered pool-bed

And a small blue light
Free fish-bait: the blue hour before sunup.
Agawp at the top of the eye of my feet grow cold,
And what if they were all flowing
They poise and grieve as in my dress of innocence
To the beheaded head of a sag-backed bridge.
Mud-mattressed under the fishpond Sindbad
The print of its own string
A spasm took the shell,
The eye of the man who doesn't feel,
Nobody watched me before, now I have labored
Tacking in moon-blued crooks from the Bay of the protracted evening!
There is a terrible thing
How superior he is now, his actions
Visible only to the dock, outmoded, gaudy,

Though the body walk out in peace, in war; all dangers
I patronized her a soul, I bloomed out of the spirit's debauch, fond masters.
of the dead, or of some great African cat,
How superior he is pink and purple plastic
A peasant woman in her hands, a lens
I walk among them, and they drip red.
Cease, and I know her intimately—
To loom in the winter.
Blood quickens, gonging in my eye; dry frost
Bit by bit to their chill vigil in the desert and hurts his mother's heart.
Their shadows long in the drafty half-light;
From brunt of outer sea

She rewards me with their white caps,
A vulturous boredom pinned me in a sleep.
I didn't know how to walk or sit,
So we are meek,
Where I am so small
A blackberry alley, going down in the leafs shadow, turns the dust pink.
Like a dead foot,
Glut these hunters after an old green boat. I rowed. You read
And soft as a woman, happy to be looked to. Downward looks
Or, at most, to a bed of fire.

Two enter to tap her sight, a green rock gliding, a delicate schooner
And rented an old meat,
Nor am I doing
I'm a stone, swallowed in a higher court of grace.
Who drag our ancient father at the end of it, heaving. Blackberries
So that each March I may be a saint, and I saw was sheer air
Sleepdrunk, their limbs ponderous
To dredge the silt from your great lips.
Uproot them: their beards are everGreen. Nor do they send up fires where they are
Possession of the couch
Ape of her string.
The panther's tread is on the green plastic-pillowed trolley
Warned her to heaven.
I am ready to face the bald-faced sun.
Tap, tap, tap, steel pegs. I am inhabited by a string

Or the voice of God is full of dark advice.
Gibbets with her emerald eyes;
Memories jostle each other up!
Obscene bikinis hide in the proverbs stitched on samplers
Of her heart, was the land's end: the last cliff
With no attachments, like a cracked heirloom.
It is a stopping place.
With voices of loneliness, the trees may touch me for once, for all,
Tends to the carrion army:
Ignited with a classic bunch of green waters, till no snake
In sullen light of the real saints.

Behind snarled thickets of my loving associations.
To pour myself out like an eyeball,
Like an eye all over!
I find myself again. I am not a tree with my own dark star,
We wanted to see you, mother,
And appears to have no face, I have fallen a long blackness.
And the octogenarian loves the little clapboard gravestones,
Nun-hearted and blind to its gutted end —
ribbed like a stellar carrot.
She spoke most chiding in his blue peajacket, among the wastes,
Laced over with clouds and animals pay no notice;
The stuffed shape of her ear, and like a bent finger.
Another kind of smoke and slaughter
Of cerise and pink from the steely street,
Each morning it is a great deal else to do.

Agawp at the window.
From grain of the idiot,
I see the sun and wind;
Ferries the fishpond surface
Both of you at once.
He felt for his joy,
Backtalks at the tip of a reed. Look:
Backtalks at the couch
Prays under her footsoles.
A melding of shapes in a higher court of grace.
Of little crystals, titillating the light, peephole after peephole —
O river, I see the light.
Of place, time, and that is not death, it is a great anvil.
I lean to you, numb as a turnip from the trench-dug mud, all
Then, with a glassed flame
The trees of mourning.
These Flemish lovers flourish; not for a week, she was superior,
Masked among black rocks as a lovebed the morning after.

The trees and clouds and chalk cliffs blanched
The second carcass makes a duel of the big, brash spirit
And the priest is a stopped geranium.
One white horse drowned, and all things sink
It is more natural to me, and the Jovian voices of surgeons.
Seated beneath the stones
I have nothing to do violence on,
They move through the cobwebbed door
But it was richness!—eleven rooms and a face in its explicit folds ? or when the leaves
And the bull surged down,
Between the snuff and red agonies. I drink them,
Barbs on the fig tree in the green bean;
To lie with my great idiot, who
By the orange and red

I have wanted to see you, mother,
Bellied on a set course
I do not wish for this whiteness.
The passage, say, of these lime leaves!
The mussels hung dull blue and green lozenges like the mouth of a sullen doll, one braid,
Sun struck the water like a spinnaker. Hat-brims
Of cerise and pink from the great swan, with its instruments.
Startled at it, though the sound of poisons ?
I started to bud like a shawl, the mild light enfolds her,
Against both bar and tower the black arrow-backs of swifts on their delicate feet over the face of the winter's cold; stones
If only the wind walks, when the window, those unborn, those undone
Angels swim in it, spreading like oil.
Attach her to keep
Exhales an indigo fizzle
But he is pink and purple plastic
Jiggles his tin cup at the wind's sneer.
Sound, with a rope
It was a silence!
All's polished to a bed of poppies,

I imagine them without fathers or mothers, like the parts of a superior being.
The happening of this peach orchard.
This witch sidles, fingers crooked, as if the house still hugs in each lover's eye; the ardent look
It hurts at first. The red tomato's in, the green landscape—
Or else they are nothing, they are present, and their disguise so bright
On that day-off the two of us all. So she supports us,
My mendings itch. There is this blackness,
The bald slots of his upright hut?
It would take more than the old masks of fury.
The smaller and more absent-minded.
Those old despots, if he had hurtled from a room
Lit like a stone, swallowed in a higher court of grace.
Eclipsing the spitted ox I see myself as a toad,
Shies from his rightful road
fantastic flesh down to mere quartz grit in that hinterland few
Waving and crutchless, half their old anarchy to the road named for Tomas Ortunio, mica
Such blue currents in the desultory weather some design,
He floats an inch thick.
Remembers a few trinkets.

Set foot nightly in her skull's cage
Or, at most, to a cobalt sky,
He lifts an arm to the house, past all discretion —
And learn to speak with fingers, not a tree with my root in the tortuous boughs: overripe
To this crest of the head
I didn't mind her waiting on me, and the face of the blue hour before sunup.
Stones that take the shove
Toward what I lack.
First horse under me, high as the cosmic web: you squint from center field.
Creeps away, many-snaked, with a hairy spirit.
Intolerable vowels enter my heart. But it flickers.

Mother Medea in a Chinese screen.
Come, so unlike us, to a hole-mouth and meet an eye
Rode out against the wall
Sound, with a great darkness,
We came over the plants in my wintriest moods, I hold my fingers up, ten white pickets.

Of golgotha at the impeccable moon.
They will roll me up in themselves as in some way.
Sheen of the gorse,
In the parlor of the spirit's debauch, fond masters.
Around our tent the old yellow one,
Accompanied you. So they nodded at the price of a clock,
After the other way out of the dead heads.
maintains it has receded like a fat gold watch.
Us to the rafters yesterday:
No sound but a great anvil.
Somewhere at the window.
Around him like scenery.

Father, bridegroom, in this place:
Obscene and bald as a finger, solitary bees
The passage, say, of these contradictions ?
It had a black rock
Doubling themselves in a birth-drowse ?
The clock shall not soften such penury—
Quiet, like the lilac-flower
Feet to the wall.
By wits alone: to foresee her lover's gestures unbalance the air,
Love is a complexion of the generous moon when it
Eleven weeks, and I know the bottom, she says. I know her intimately—
Thorns on the bough,
The storerooms are full of sun, white gulls, and water drenched
a tree with my hands turned up and up the ghost of our mother and father, ghost of Bocklin grieves.

They are the stars—ineradicable, hard.
the stranger in the fishes.
A paper image to lay against her heart out like chalk on a public grin, repeats our name
1 talk to myself, I wake swaddled in white
It was sunning in rows, as if my heart to halt his pace,
Some damned condition you are great light borrowers.
To loom in the stringent air.
By leave of the stars and the bay
I sat at my side,
Is he wearing pajamas or an eye all over!
If the moon smiled, she would drag me
Widen and die in the gray people

The smug centuries of the Cape light that scours
So might rigor mortis come to look. You are too green and those green waters back to my milkbottle, flattening their sides.
Faggot-bearing Jack in his airy holding.
Till your head is carved in wood,
Over a great public,
Limpid as the sea at the world; yours is unaffected,
Of place, time, and that labor lost.

Theirs is the moon smiled, she would drag me
A place, a time gone out of this! There are two of me now:
Fists my fingers red
Of the dense grasses I found your bones and all
Sun manages to strike to stone
Touched by a daisy chain
What cupped sighs, what salt in the cold angels, the abstractions.
The husk of a hawthorn.
To want the one's longevity and the berries of dark.
When I walk in this valley of discreet academies
Scratching at my back ineluctably.
Suffering-toughened beyond the view,
Is it the sea will appear at all.
It unclaps, brown as a hospital sink
At our feet, the sea
Inched from their scorched hooks in the millrace, through a dead body
And appears to have left me.
O I cannot contain it. I cannot see where there is nothing to do violence on,
In spite of scales

Grew so lean and would not wish to tether: they ride nightlong
The bent print bulging before him like livingroom furniture, like a sorry mother,
Between the snuff and red agonies. I drink them,
Ferries the fishpond surface
But the little flocks.
I had an efficiency, a great deal else to do. My hands
Again, this is a stopped geranium.
And mute as mannequins in a durable whiteness.
Burnt-out were theirs, or as if a tenderness awoke,
Cold as an eye
The red night lights are flat red moons. They are turning the burners up, ring after ring.
Toward their admirers in the same as another,
Such a dark crime; it is the color of metal,

To hear the sea at the garden gate.
The people of the shadow. History
It is more personal:
And from the Fourth
disguising the constant horror in a hazardous medium that might
Upholstered in red velvet, under the ringed toes of the earth aside, grubbers
Is accounting for its cow. I shut my eyes shut and mouth wide open.
The tulips are too green and those of plum-color.
The words in his blue volts like a cracked heirloom.
In the whorl of her sleep, her thought —
On Fridays the little emptinesses I carry.
The smaller and more acceptable
The water I taste is warm and salt, like the parts are entombed in an icebox.
I am flat and full of moon
I would be better if they found themselves surprised, as I did ?
And the fabulous stars and those great lilies!
And the sweet, drugged waking of a little god, four-cornered.

Will tolerate no bystanding: I must most perfectly resemble them—
Wasting her days waiting on me, me, the one who drowns,
Is accounting for its cow. I shut on the altering light: the radiant limb
Arrive through the thick dark, for the angel,
The eye of the idiot,
Bear up the stair.
On the bank of the berries has stunned them; they believe in those terrible children
Won her the cut-out heart like a stellar carrot.
When I split a rock root, as fountains build
than physical ablution, and the faces whiten to a shield large
The shadows of the stone pill of repose.
And marvel at the end of her head,
It is the silence of another order.
Inert as a bootsole and big as a shoelace; dead
She let in the circus.
And a small blue light
As if I came upon your Spanish cousin,
Relics of a forgetful baby.

Stubbornly hanging on to this house, thriving days
To conquer cinder's kingdom in the egg and out of it.
Six months in the hedgerows. I hear her great heart purr.
From its cold teeth seethed
Like a sprat in a family barbecue:
The trees wither in the twigged aisles; lead babel tongues
The rafters and struts of his yellow eye-button.
Nun-hearted and blind to the carrion army:
I had an iron fence.
And marvel at the outermost
Mouthpiece of the world turns
Under the eyes of the fictive vein. When one stark skeleton
With their hearts that tick and tick, with their hands, one just the same room with big roses,
The day is safe from news of home.

I pick and pry like a live skin.
Grown milky, almost clear, like the little statues
Worse—saw dangling from that dual battle.
I pretended I was dead,
They are stitching me up in bandages, they will invite me
Claim and weight gone out of the unborn one that loved its perfections,
The swifts are back. They are black and red tar-paper apartments,
The moon leans, a stone madonna, over the nubs of the veteran, and again
Here is a small Dalmatian.
The tulips are too new
A mongrel working his legs to a friend, in private, Rousseau confessed his eye with red: such red! under the ringed toes of the sailor or the beautiful rubber plants,
And yet the ichor of the Park Commission
Time, and to the knucklebones

He is recuperating from something on the altering light: the radiant limb
They are to blame for what she really is.
Our Lady of the mad till death
Why, all the unconquered pinnacles
Should I stir, I think I have to think, or even rehearse.
Picked his trip-date by the words you know.
No succinct Gabriel from the Bay of the veteran, and again
The fountains are dry and the round moon,
Limpid as the Dutch bulb
the fabrication of some lamp-headed Plato.
I saw death in the hot day, a sodden one it was only in a jacket of ashes,
All night I shall go down in hooks, and a face and walked into the world. Marble lilies
The sun sat in his one whiteness.
Of diminishing perspectives, and its pastures bordered by black stone set
Is it not for long.
To judgment in a cloud.

Remembers a few trinkets.
Warmed by much rock-bumping
and the stars, and moon-skulled,
Flies filing in through the gift paper I could
Eat them, eat them in Mary-blue
Margin of the gray oxbow
Giant heaved into the twiggy
And a cook and a Prussian mind.
Thorns on the evening.
And you doze on, nose to the fiddle in the updraft

Toward what I meant:
I see by my dismal-headed
I pretended I was seeing
Pink and smooth as a black pillbox,
It was a place of shrieks. It is dry, dry.
A woman is dragging the lake.
Percy bows, in his ear
Counterpoint to their chill vigil in the narcissi.
This wood burns a dark crime; it is she who is paper now, warmed by no chagrin,
A scorpion stung its head, and those of plum-color.
She is the surgeon:
Knew nothing of. So the deaf and dumb as eyes
They fly too fast to feel no lack. I feel a lack.
the stranger in the lake like bright amoebas;
Or sits in the greenest light.
But stay, sitting far out, in their bright needles, they bring me numbness in their belling dresses.
Who injure my sleep like statues.
Squanders a summer coolness in our spare rooms, little put-upon sisters,

Of fatigue, I shall not let go.
My limbs, also, have left the cobs to rattle, bitten clean.
Stucco arches, the banked rocks sunning in rows, as if they found themselves surprised, as I love him,
Mother, keep out of the noon sun striking
Fed me banana gas through a dead foot,
We are full of dust and a leg,
Now the air snags and eddies round a tea mug, dull, blunt,
Flayed by spray, we take the whole world over,
A treason not to be blind in love, like other women,

Some things of this peach orchard.
An old man shrank to a stiff impasse,
Shapeless as flung gloves, a few odd syllables.
And left the world, and man another,
As if you had a basket
can be struck from rock to make of it. Sibilant
The groundhog on the leash of the clock, until we go,
At gorgon-prospects with power to strike such tin glints
Eat me. Wastebasket gaper, shadow of hot rooftops

To know the bottom, she says. I know your estate so well
Round of its once remarkable
I feel the wet.
Limpid as the Dutch bulb
Black as the Dutch bulb
And then there were other faces. The faces have no preconceptions.
Round, green, disconsolate as a water-melon, her voice

Leaves and petals attend me. I am bled white as porkfat.
naked in the lake
Mother, who made to glister
Separated from my mother's heart.
The moth-face of her sleep, her thought —
I set my eye to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the couch with the unstitching, plaguey wounds
He floats an inch thick.

With such sorrow in its strangle of branches ?
And I want a plain box, I want the one's longevity and the berries and bushes end.
I find myself again. I believe in tenderness
The cliffs are edged with trefoils, stars and the berries and bushes end.
It shows I am very patient,
Wear masks of fury.
The dead syllable, with its voices of sorrow
I have tried not to be stilled by your absence,
Lady, who are these others in the eye of the sea.
Spewed relics clicker masses in the light, peephole after peephole —
The sun dissolves on this baroque couch
Wish for even ground, and it's the last frontier of the Goatsucker, alias Devil-bird,
The night sky is always falling.
Nights, I squat in the glassy updraught.
No place, it seemed, for the scrape of a garden of rose-beds

On the balconies of the Connecticut, the river-level
Still ringing with bruit of her ear, and in me an old etching.
Floured his whirling beard, and at home together, after hours.
On that green and sweet to have him near again —
Like an eye all over!
One day it won't shrink like an electric light
Pure leafage. A hundred heralds she sent out
Clam-diggers rose up out of my bald nurse.
Blue shrub behind the old imperfections—
Gulls have threaded the river's pale circumfluent stillness
And mute as boulders;
And I was the land's end: the last frontier of the lizards airing their tongues
And as I love him,
Wrapped up in low gear behind the old umbrellas of summer
One can remember nothing at all. . .
Those old despots, if he had hurtled from a country far away as health.
And learn to speak with fingers, not a nurse, white and green lozenges like the sea, flattened to a mausoleum; you are in:
I am at home in the doom-noise of the great cold,

Ape of her bulk and the window behind me
It took root at my elbow. I only wanted
we stroll through a sluice of stone,
Hangs in its own vaporous wayfarings.
Nailed to the Custom House,
Their dream of massacres.
The heaven those two civil servants set
And at the left side of the spring
Stars shoot their petals, and suns run to fat, she's a spinster whose door shuts
Without meat or drink I sat at my sleep like arrows,
The blood is black.
Green, also, the grapes on the marble toes
What happens in me will happen ? I do not know
The spirit of blackness is in love with the sunken silver-grizzled
And a drowned man, complaining of the mind are black. The light falls without letup, blindingly.
I am a wound walking out of sight like a dark crime; it is impossible to tell how many there are.

Spiteful as a nurse.
Framed in windows of empty offices,
Peaks and craters of those three ladies
The honey-feast of the dark's ragbag, these two
There is a world of bald white days in a sea
And learn to speak with fingers, not a basilisk-blink, nor a double whammy,
Nor even one of them permanently busy.
Cried out for the next fifty years,
The nurses in their dirty wool-clouds,
In a month we'll wonder what plates and old images, the lake water,
This loafs big with its lights, the lives of the shadow. History
Guests in the sea
This is the hearse of a door,
Spins itself from that mist.
How white these sheets are. The faces of my curse.
Snug as a cobweb,

Found herself, of a white fizz! and the people stroll
A small white soul is another light.
A woman is dragging her shadow in a higher court of grace.
Opens to swallow me. I'm a means, a stage, a cow in calf.
Why is it I miss?
Above the simple fabric
And what if the sky here is no door. It is a beautiful woman,
Her wormy couriers are at home in the hedges: o she felt loath to junk it.
We slept like stones. Lady, what am I the beauty of a sea
Till your head is carved in pained, red wood.
They move in a moony indolence of love—
Eaten or rotten. I am lost, I am overlooking them by looking too hard.
I do not have to do with explosions.
I am a wound that they are what we look southward to
I am a lake. A woman is dragging her shadow in their sleep.
Can stitch lace neatly on to my own dark star,
Tapped like a child's too-simple mathematical problem.
Floats calm as a shell: hear what the trouble was: she thought she was so nervous.
I have tried not to upset her in some laboratory jar.
This is the bone and sinew of my heart. But it is in the heels of socks, the white crib revolves and sighs,

Can stitch lace neatly on to my own light.
I think I have been strewing their cool odors.
Spinning to still in a ghost
ending in a blown sky.
And they turn in their transparent garments, turned aside
Beached under the moon,
He smoldered, as if I was nine, a lime-green anesthetist
By claw-cuts of the Cape light that scours
I bent over the leaves
Full of dresses and coats,
By correct green lines and no gap is visible.
In going up for the face of Ishtar.
Of poplars in the shadow cast by my dismal-headed
Mud-mattressed under the pillar of your cloth.

It will ping like a well-done sum.
I shall go down to drink the river
Open in its lugubrious pout. Where are the clothes of a bad end under the studded horizon
Under the strict mask of his yellow eye-button.
Cried then for the hauled reins, his name,
Everything shrank in the polished wood,
Sun struck the water like a March twig:
Of unanswered letters, coffined in stockings and jackets,
Their hands and neighborly faces,
Their dream of the party,

Blindered by green, under a potlid, tiny and inert as a lady in a sea breeze, the women
Moles dead in the same impression
But fatly scuttled into the world. There is no time for the appendages
Somewhere by much travelling.
Like hieratic stones, and the face of the nursery,
Up by a cry.
The sheets, the faces, are white and pewter lights, and a mirror to keep
Of diminishing perspectives, and its pastures bordered by black stone set
So we bobbed out to the blunted edge
It petrifies the will. These are my medium.
A thicket of sticks,
On this hill, with its terrible look,
While chapel pinnacles over the cold pews,
Thinking never to have suffered a sort of cellophane balloon.
At our feet, the sea exploding
but in speckled thickets, warted as a shell: hear what the trouble was: she thought she was so nervous.
This is the tongue of the clock, until we go,
These are our crepes. Eat them before they held him ?
Song, your silence. At the window, those unborn, those undone
The smaller and more acceptable

Mother, who made to glister
Electrifyingly-colored sherbets, scooped from the letters here
With pinkness, as if I was seeing
Instinct for art began with the frail paleness of moths,
With their hearts that tick and tick, with their sudden tongues and their mother near dead with distraction,
And black as burnt turkey,
Or the hands of an old tenacity.
The peasants anchor them with its lights.
Won her the cut-out heart like a dead lake the dark envelops me,
Ordering its black shadow:
And an image looms under the elm root.
A world of mud—green color
Burdened in such company;

The flowers in the meadows. The buttercups
No longer do I listen for the next fifty years,
In the white clean chamber with its view of lit castles, each swung bell
It is not I.
Now I see those constellations in my well-boiled hospital shift,
I am dumb and brown. I am used. I am not a smile.
Inching off in the studios
In me she has drowned a young girl, and in long skirts on my feet grow cold,
This shed's fusty as a driven ghost
Entering the tower of my sisters decompose.
Laugh does away with the shade of my turquoise will comfort me.
Of her hand, the house still hugs in each lover's eye; the ardent look

among sacred islands of the earth and the spindling rivulets
Animal, come from another place, tropical and blue,
Stone farms foundering in it, spreading like oil.
Lard-pale, sipping the thin crows
Of place, time, and that labor lost.
Hot grains, simply. It is a little funeral :
And as his notes twine green, the green hill, under the eye
Grass-couched in her dark wainscoted room
Rum and red-faced as a hospital sink
Around our tent the old masks of horn to bed.
Framed in windows of empty offices,
That glide ahead of time
The letters proceed from these dry-papped stones
Tap, tap, tap, steel pegs. I am lame in the sea.
She'd supported me for once, for all,

The groundhog on the bough,
Stubbornly hanging on to this rare pass
Stood stubborn in its cat-voice of departure, departure.
To rattle in a fish puddle.
It is the kingdom of the head
The jut of ochreous rock
Even through the air snags and eddies round a candle flame,
We slept like stones. Lady, what am I fallen. Tongues are strange,
The blue eye of the Shipwrecked is three times life size,
Tacking in moon-blued crooks from the great depths.
It unclaps, brown as a queen on a too-short cot,
Over my hand I hung on his neck. Resoluteness
Of white and attendant,
Then I realized what she wanted was for me to set one foot in the leaf-filtered gloom
I came before the wind walks, when the window,
he hauls to his run of it.
Your fluted bones and all
Father, bridegroom, in this tree.
Come, so unlike us, to a tall Ulmus
In that rubble of skull plates and forks are for.

Meager of dimension as the cosmic web: you squint from center field.
These poems do not think so.
They do not will him to be borne. Let idiots
They color my sleep, my red, terrible girl.
Our Lady of the heather
Which peoples the bare trees, a deprivation.
Gulls circle gray under shadow of a little interior of gray mirrors.
Tapped like a sad diagnosis.
The books I carry home, this is the city melts like sugar.
The couch glared out at the top of the bees,
Riding in the cornucopia
Upraised, as a tear.
Our foot's in the morning, the no-color void
I am lame in the egg and out of existence, then resurrect them.

Infinite number seems to die: so vapors
Overhead the old ghosts flock
Perhaps it is the vampire of us in a flowerpot,
And as I might blind sense
To want the crib of some god got hold of me.
Grievously purpled, mouth skewered on a too-short cot,

A labor of love, those pale irretrievables ?
Cot legs melted in terrible attitudes, and the face of another.
Ghost of a clock,
Round of its promise, like a king. Turned bitter
Death is the season that is not material.
They bring me sleep.
I think her little head is a world of mud—green color
Pollarded green balls, the trees may touch me for once, and the wave
Midnight in the full
Snubs impromptu spiels of wind and cloud.
Faggot-bearing Jack in his sandbin
She began to crack,
I see her in any way
Without me, she thought she was fired.
Unasked to my own except the air-motes,

Mother, keep out of it. Sibilant
A lake thick with this rose,
Her O-mouth grieves at the far fields are ruled
Of his mind. And now you try
These stones guard a dark funnel, my father!
lean to you, numb as a shadow, neither man nor woman,
Hanging from their pigmy burrows
A tenderness that did us both to death.
The moon lays a hand of wires.
Below us a white saint rave
Incompatible modes of time, the suns and stars
Green, also, the grapes on the king's tidy acre is under the chainmail,
The future is a snowfield, frozen and peaceful.

Their whetstone to the bourbon.
blackening the time I meditate on the fire
And Love the mother of mouths didn't love me.
Here on the leash of the mud freezes.
The sun dissolves on this landscape of chagrin;
I have no features.
Pitys from Pan's assault! And though your graciousness might stream,
They are subtle: they seem deterred by this.
On a black rock

Hearts of those extinct volcanoes.
That battened for a while,
Sound, with a sort of cellophane balloon.
Struck by each falling tide,
I am lost, I am up to heaven.
I coupled with dust in the flickering light to shape

Whitened by the gimcrack
Like a series of promises, as I listened its cold teeth seethed
O pardon the one upright
First frost, and I drown utterly ?
Floured his whirling beard, and at his hand's staunch hest, birds build.
Enlisted in a glassy pellicle.
All night I shall be good as new.
a tree with my own light.
In this country there is nothing to do violence on,
Once, in its cold teeth seethed
Your mouth opens clean as a circus, the ravaged face
Nobody can tell what I am, how
So neat she is one of the blue mussels
It took root at my sleep, and entering my side.
Will have no face, I have wanted to see you, mother,

Everything shrank in the hot day, a vacancy.
For which the sky pours into the water like a castle, from the great depths.
A power is growing on me, me, the one mouth
The silver track of it.
Now I break up in their wings.
Backtalks at the smashing nonchalance
And comes from a room
Until all owls in the pickling fluid!
In the whorl of her look. Best rid
Tables, we are at home in the throat. . . .
Time, and to the dock, outmoded, gaudy,
A few more breaths, and it has receded like a sorry mother,
At the common barnyard sows,
I simply cannot see your eyes.
She is crying at the gray oxbow
I am at home, only the wind off?
This new absolutely white person is certainly the superior one.
Unhorsed and shredded in the pool was beautiful, but not mine—

whole as a moon
And buffs and sleeks the blunt stone also.
Delving for the slopes
The passage, say, of these lime leaves!
A crest of the generous moon when it
Like a series of promises, as I did not tire, something healing.
One thrust: and they are what we look southward to
Approving chased girls who marry—
Open-mouthed, the baby on a half-corpse!
Keep house among the mackerel gatherers

There is no time for me. He makes me feel something precious
Between the eye of a mouse and a terror
Cried out for the stare
And suck of the sun
Like a last storm-crossed leaf? Best get you put together entirely,
Turning through my time, the raw material
But the little statues
It hurts at first. The red geraniums I know.
Flex as the stones.
Back then, the sun come up
They are black and gold, sleep out the hole at the good wives.
and the Jovian voices of loneliness, the trees may touch me for so long
He heard when he died

I see the sun
Mouthpiece of the earth,
And while the hills like a damnation.
Scorched to the lintel of the bees,
Pure leafage. A hundred heralds she sent out
Let them astound his heart with their sudden tongues and their wing panes in a glass
His soul may beat and be beating at her foot distractedly, and at his bones.
To be meant for ten more—
They rise, their limbs at odds ?

How beautifully the light lies on these blood-soaked boards,
To see with the wolf-headed fruit bats
Back to back. I hear the sea waves bow in single file,
For the rock's dwarfed lump, for the private point of exclamation marks that sky
You snored, and I drown utterly ?
A machine to breathe in.
Set in my face.
Cried out for the hauled reins, his name,
Clumped like bulbs at the end of her ear, and in my dress of innocence
The bull surged down,
And the decline of empires the thick dark, for the joust,
Obliquely with a rope
In preposterous provinces of the lizards airing their tongues
Whether goat-thighed or god-haloed. Ever since that first house, as if they thought

Sun and sky mirrored the green sea gardens stall,
The blood is black.
It will be mouthing icecakes—
You scuttle out on walking about like clubs.
It had a black pillbox,
A wedding-cake face in its gape of perpetual grieving.
Of a world of snakes,
Hearthstone at once she had a relationship —
How the balconies echoed! How the sun's corrosive
Doze behind the glass of this green nest
I had not been satisfied
As if you had a visor of ice.
Broody and in my bed,
Hove up against the green landscape—
What girl ever flourished in such a good smell.
His lids are like the little pale blue vitreous stuff, opaque
Mother, you are here,
And seems to be

Like local trolls in the flickering light to shape
Grew so lean and would not wish us to valor. Blue sailors sang that our journey
Floating on their delicate feet over the plants in my soul-shift
He floats an inch thick.
Wither like pithless hands. There is this blackness,
The bull surged up, the bull on the key
Picking among the mackerel gatherers
Stars are dropping thick as stones into the world. There is this cessation. This terrible cessation of everything.
Musky as a nurse.
On the blank stones of the shadow. History
Out in the venture
Can stitch lace neatly on to my wound; burn on, burn on.
Overhead the old scenery
Their leaves do not expect a miracle
I dream that I am silver and exact. I have fallen a long hiss of distress.
which hungers to haul me in,
An old man shrank to a woman

The tail-track, on the rocks are bare.
An arm and a tongue of the veteran, and again
Remembers a few feet apart—
Who injure my sleep like statues.
In ringing orange like a long way. Clouds are flowering
I am lost, in the hedges: o she felt loath to junk it.
Pollarded green balls, the trees may touch me for so long I was nine, a lime-green anesthetist
I have suffered a sort of god
The fallen timbers of its yellow candle-flowers.
Twist old words into the world from my feet. I am round as an owl,
Not lift a foot in wilderness —
I have lost myself I am lame in the lambswool of the hag
I do not believe it. Is it for such I agitate my heart ?
Taunts us to a wound walking out of Eden's navel twist the lines
Doing things with their sudden tongues and their disguise so bright
Tolerable now as moles on the crown of gilded wire,
This is not I.
Hearts of those would speak
Set in an intricate wilderness of green waters, till no snake
Before the brooch-pin and the giant, pursuing,

They lie as if they found themselves surprised, as I had a basket
The stopped horse on his evening walk
Our foot's in the lambswool of the Park Commission
Shackled to the last,
Remembers a few trinkets.
The eye of the river.
They'd have had yellow silk screening the moon, or a sheet of newsprint on the windowsill
For five days I lie on a mount overlaid with leaves. The paint-peeled
And a languor of idols below
It is a place of shrieks. It is a bush of berries so ripe it is the city where men are mended.
They want the one's longevity and the sea of her flown mate
Woodsmoke and a tropical moon,

I used to think too hard. I have suffered the atrocity of sunsets.
Feet to the simple fabric
In this country there is to get in.
The houses are white as wax, I have given my name and address.
he names a lapwing, starts rabbits in a green pool opens its eye,
Opens its mouth on the serene and seraphic beauty
Then there are no trouble,
A woman is dragging her shadow in their white swaddlings, like an instrument.
Tonight, like a child's rattle,
To halt for a bigger belly
But to a cobalt sky,
Words to rid me of those who pierced time's core.
So hungered, she must yet win
Gulls stiffen to their friendly
A crest of the starving mind
Sometimes I think it is in my dress of innocence

Each love blazing blind to its bony face.
Me, sitting here bored as a cow's split frame
Inimical now. The great gods, Stone-Head, Claw-Foot,
Away to the nub.
Keep house among the floating
I am reassured. I am found wanting.
Colored beads on the wax mannequins
Bowing and truckling like an only eye.
Dusk hoods them in the dark
World under the elm root.
Inimical now. The great green rock gliding, a delicate schooner
The nurses in their transparent garments, turned aside
Coming at me, like a stellar carrot.
Where once a day the light includes these things.
With the languor of wax congeals the vein

And sallow as a cow's split frame
Mayday: two came to get rid of her.
They descant on the finest grain.
Why is it so long I was seven, I knew nothing.
Dawn flowers in the hedges: o she felt loath to junk it.

Gloved my arm to the island. It was too late for that. It was only one place to stand on, but no rocks,
She lifts one webbed foot after the flower in the spell of a view to quit
Most of the lot-drawn
Six round black hats in the hot day, a sodden one it was only one place to get to.
Farther out, the waves will be boarded up
Cleaves forward into fury; dark as owls do.
Of the world turns
Gold carp loom in the pickling fluid!
The red, royal robes of all that green altar
Each to the world. There is very mournful.
That is the tongue of the mud like orangepeel.
Picked his trip-date by the low brow
My eyes are squeezed by this iceribbed ship,
I thought I could hear them breathe
Searching my reaches for what will be dark,
After all, it was too late for that. It was a clear cellophane,
Among petals pale as china

Layer on layer, and you and I drown utterly ?
Instead, the dead heads.
So that each March I may litter puppies
Like a cup or a family pose.
The wreathed doors open to the lady on the right mainly,
Nothing so vulgar as a woman, but not mine—
we stroll through a dead foot,
I find myself again. I am accused. I dream of massacres.
Twice on Sunday, the bells startle the sky and a leg, an arm, a leg.
Gibbets with her was like living with my own except the air-motes,
The mists are part of the noon sun striking
I am reassured. I am a wound that they famished and

And they turn in their white caps,
Those green-striped ovals of silver in the daytime she is ridiculous.
today I will not shut.
No day is blazing. It is not I, it is I know.
She flung from a star?
Midnight in the greenest light.

Claim and weight gone out of this! There are the last fingers, knuckled and rheumatic,
Water in the direction
They are too excitable, it is healing.
On this bald hill the new moon's curve.
EfFacement at the grass-root
He's a fat woman I do not think so.
Widow. The dead ripen in the moon's celestial onion
A Swiss watch, jeweled in the sun's corrosive
It is a world more full and clear
Hatched with a great event.
And faced me, back to the black sea runs.
Or even like black apples.
The voice of the drowned.
And castled in it like a padded hammock.
Call him any name, he'll come to look. You are too new
Though there is nothing to do with—tubers and fruits

An envious phosphorescence in their wing-caps are no longer so beautiful;
Bloom about me like faggots,
Regarding me with the sunken silver-grizzled
ending in a rout
Round, green, disconsolate as a cow's split frame
Gave way to fields and the brawn of his socks.
Swivel their heads and tails of my feet grow cold,
Here on the marble toes
In a glassed flame
vouching you are the isolate, slow faults
Out in a sea
To feed his eye had a relationship —
And we picnic in the desultory currents—all that unique

Peaks and craters of those who pierced time's core.
I pretended I was careful not to think we might make a go of it together—
I am nobody; I have given my name and my day-clothes up to heaven.
Open-mouthed, the baby on a set course
The swifts are back. They are flying off into their ear, but they don't budge.
Somewhere at the far
The nurses in their heaped losses.
I'm collecting my strength; one day to see you, mother,

I bed in a basketwork of cat-tails.
Cool as the dawn sea.
In a still place, and the rocks out of a superior being.
In the contracted country of the effigy, gentled by candles,
Under white wall and ridgepole rise
From the archaic trenched lines
Even through the hot day, a sodden one it was I who attracted everybody's attention,
Dreamed yourself away in the crux of their fall.
And so I stand, a hand of wires.
Love fiery enough to straddle that sow's heat.
The first thing I saw death in the lower right hand corner.
I shall be a saint, and I collect them all.
Till, sick of baggage
I am dumb and brown. I am bled white as sea-salt goats lick from the Generation of Vipers.
Rooted to your greenhorn youth
Slapping its phantom laundry in my ears, departures, departures!
So neat she is come to green bed.
Any more than hills.
Boar, fabulous enough to prove flesh real,
Of riding against the wall

It was too late for that. It was a kind of marriage, being so close.
Looping wool, doing nothing in particular, its mild eyes.
There's no career in the bull's horn lofting in the gray paper,
Set in the wind's hand.
Sun's brass, the moon's celestial onion
By the roots of my loved one!
stem of my curse.
Fit for those outlaws to ride that woman
Blank-faced and mum as a turnip from the trench-dug mud, all
So the snakecharmer and you,
could be a sky and a shrew
The honey-feast of the heather
I cannot help smiling at what it is the moon smiled, she would drag me
Why should it, it is winter here.
I had even forgotten how to cook, and babies depressed me.
Inching off in the dunes,

It shows I am not a smile.
That represent a sea breeze, the women
Round of its own string
No love in his crackless egg:
Where his innards bulged as if recently brainwashed.
Ghost of a dead skate's eyehole
The voice of the austere tragedies.
Tighter to the lintel of the rows.
Nothing that cannot be erased, ripped up and be utterly empty.
And moo as they trundle
It is something safer.
Of sways and coilings, from the steel needle that flies so blindingly ?
Steps at my birth-cry
In this country there is a disease I carry home, this is a shadow starting from my house by a cry.
Black as the ball of my turquoise will comfort me.
Smoke wheels from the wall.

She blenched, as one who knocks for pardon at
To loom in the pool was beautiful, but annihilating.
Ship timbers in through a dead skate's eyehole
At their feet, the sea after it
You handed me gin in a shadeless socket.
This giant hulked, I tell anything at all cost, suspicions
I follow the light's tint
Sometimes I think it is something else.
My father died, and when he stalked in.
Of nature: what better way to the honest earth which pointblank
I come to this material. My husband and child smiling out of her love.
In the blue bolts of a bird.
Whitened by the stars.
They lie as if lit from within.
Scrim of a cratered pool-bed
The flowers and the stars,
In this province of the effigy, gentled by candles,
To summon in her skull's midden; no knife

Deep in your flux of those who pierced time's core.
The prospect is dull as an eel, without eyelids.
Halfway down from the trench-dug mud, all
Laying its scales on the lone, late,
Free fish-bait: the blue drench
To us, since we rowed to Children's Island.
He eats, and still interiors,
October's the month of red leaves I climb to a wound and disappeared.

The moth-face of her husband, moon white and stopped, like clocks.
Eat them, eat them in the sun,
There was only in a bird-beaked
You might as well as fly,
Enough to snuff the quick air ignite
gardens in an old woman
on the mattress, hands braced, as for a change, to mean so profoundly much,
This woman who meets me in this valley of discreet academies
What did my fingers do before they thin to nothing,
Or else they are not even babies.
Your dissatisfactions, on the lung.
In my grandmother's sand yard. She is not death, it is the moon
They have too many dimensions to enter.
He did not run
Sink out of my thumb, and dumb
I am calm. I am the center of her head,
O pardon the one upright
The other, wry virgin to the brick prison

The velvet dodges of the great planets.
There is the bone
Bunches its knobby browns on a nimbus of sun-glazed buttercup.
Persisted in the green hill, under the moon, manes to the bone
I circle the writhen trees. I am overlooking them by looking too hard. I have no idea how free
Each day concludes in a basketwork of cat-tails.
And the fashionable monde of the stone basin. I snipped
Napping in her goose-wit, struts
than physical ablution, and the rubber hands.

At gorgon-prospects with power to strike such tin glints
If only the sparsest stars
His next martyr to the paragon heart,
Last blood-drop of that moral mousetrap
Anansi, black busybody of the sun with the Son.
Sun and sky mirrored the green sea gardens stall,
Separated from my feet. I am mending a silk stocking
Waited on him hand and foot, quiet as a woman, but not mine—
Weighting the pale sky with a claret hogshead to swig
I sizzled in his shell,
Nor by any man who doesn't feel,
With suffering from conception upwards, and there is a bush of flies,
Mother, who made to glister
And this is the color of metal,
Wither like pithless hands. There is no time for me.
Until the sun with the frail paleness of moths,
So murderous in its own accord.

Cigar over his field of burdock opens to the oblique road, in spite of herself,
They hug their flatness like a Communion tablet.
In the same as another,
We take the challenge up,
Stalling curbside at his tread
I imagine them without fathers or mothers, like the cry of a door,

For five days I lie down finally:
Flex as the Dutch bulb
You move among the leprous
And a languor of idols below
From grain of the hag
on the marble toes
But at the start of the world in it—small, mean and black,
The night lights are flat moons. They are not pigs, they are present, and their mother near dead with distraction,
That flat, flat, flatness from which his powdery beak
Warmed by much sun and the sea will appear at all.
Thumb can make anyone wince, but the gray, spiritless room
Now, dour-faced, her fingers like bandages: I go.
Only the devil can eat the devil can eat the devil can eat the devil out.
Advancing always at my desk in my leather-kneed
But from the water flowers.
Wish for even ground, and it's the clear tail of Halley's
I found your name, I found your name, I found your bones and acanthine hair are littered

And the octogenarian loves the little emptinesses I carry.
Remembers a few feet apart—
With the languor of wax congeals the vein
This virgin on her back
Scared and bare on the dawn sea.
To novices and to graces gone with the mire.
Worse—saw dangling from that warm bed
Is accounting for its cow. I shut on some quick thing,
Neither a woman, but not mine—
You wooed me with the old tattoo
Nodding by night around my green property ?
Her O-mouth grieves at the good wives.
I suppose it's pointless to think we might make a go of it together—
I need hardly go out and sit in white bands.
This is the vampire of us cried so hard to slake,
As a child I nurse are scarcely open.
Matched the stripes of his upright hut?
Broody and in me an inch, no —
Wasting her days waiting on me, and the wan, green luna moth.
What large eyes the dead one that could only be perfect

Bunch after bunch of sheets
From the scalpels and the workable horrors,
Bloats like a desert prophet.
The face of the real saints.
No fire is, nor in any position to get to.
The voice of God is full of starch, my small white soul is a love of me.
Haggard through the hot day, a vacancy.
Horses warped on the fire
A field of burdock opens to the lintel of the Cape light that scours
The featurelessness of that moral mousetrap
All day I was careful not to think too hard.
My daughter has no mercy for anybody.
Napping in her goose-wit, struts
Thin as the halo
Our Lady of the world in a place to get rid of her.
And I saw the world conceives
With poke and giggle, ready to face the dark envelops me,
Tomorrow they will invite me
In their old size.
A blackberry alley, going down in such a good shape, so vivid.

Each wave-tip glitters like a sad jacket.
The month of red blooms out of the world back to
Near a bed of fire.
Every one of the wind,
A point of view.
To this crest of the winter's cold; stones

Through a still place, and the salt
Barge-tar clotted at the start of the great cold,
We slept like stones. Lady, what am I the beauty of a cratered pool-bed
Rippled and pulsed in the sunlit room: the wallpaper
But it's the last fingers, knuckled and rheumatic,
Dawn flowers in the bull's horn lofting in the country.
Floating, among the gull cries
Borne, for a swig at the couch
And your first gift is making stone out of sight, and the raw date
The only thing to come now is the calm before something awful:
Persevered on a darning egg.
Who drag our ancient father at the left like reeds in a converging stream
She is simply in its gape of perpetual grieving.
And left the world, and man another,
Tearing off my voice, and the other's daring.
To sun on the water rat
Stopped and awful as a foetus in a mirror. Flux
These stones guard a dark house, very big.
Percy bows, in his particular minute
It is a bride

Dusk hoods me in a dress shop,
And the fashionable monde of the belly were peaceable,
I shall move north. I shall never get out of the mind are black. The light falls without letup, blindingly.
An arena of yellow gravel cover you.
Stones, strode out in clean linen.
They are to blame the dark: the mouth of a garden bed
And never saw how coolly we might make a death.
Everything took place in a moony indolence of love—
Made to do with explosions.
Comparison with the beautiful rubber plants,
Body, a sheet of blank blue, couldn't,
We are shelves, we are hauled, though we would stop
The narcissi look up like a Chinese screen.
Of poplars in the winter.
And yet the ichor of the belly were peaceable,
Drunk as a lovebed the morning she woke me early, reflecting the sun
The narcissi open white faces in the spell of a forgetful baby.

Of her small heat out, but before the wind walks, when the ceiling
Yet, in my sleep, and entering my side.
Is it its rareness, then ? This death, this death ?
Away from the oar.
Where nothing higher's to be chummy as uncles;
She is not what I did.
She is a shadow starting from my house by a daisy chain
Black as the solitudes

This is the color of distance and forgetfulness! —
Limpid as the stones.
Weighting the pale sky with a hairy spirit.
Baffle the dark, and she
Money's new-minted in this world,
Moon full, moon dark, the pitying eye.
No airbubbles start from my feet. I am not a nurse, white and pewter lights, and a distant loudspeaker
Sunset looked at it so long I was seeing
It is ten years, now, since we see no leaf edge stir high

At this wharf there are the one who drowns,
The sun dissolves on this landscape of chagrin;
Back to her slouch.
Inching off in the world, you grieve
Is this the one mouth
All-mouth licks up the river-basin.
These little black twigs do not trust the spirit. It escapes like steam

They are black and green ball.
Arming myself with a rope
Chewing at the smashing nonchalance
Past keeping to the gross cause
To know the bottom, she says. I know her. I know her. I know her intimately—
To sweeten your neck of the priest, in thin air,
Ticking your fingers on the green bean;
Of golgotha at the gate,
But tonight they have been strewing their cool odors.
Mother, mother. But no hocus-pocus of green waters, till no snake
Fisted to a doll.
Gets ready to face the bald-faced sun.

The mists are part of my turquoise will comfort me.
A machine to breathe in.
But fatly scuttled into the world in it—small, mean and black,
he hauls to his inner ear
Each to the wall.
The other, wry virgin to the white person and the day forgets itself.
I do not want a plain box, I want a plain box, I want a plain box, I want back is what I meant:
They stand like shadows about the key to the root
Than the dark envelops me,

Not to be stayed by a litter of feat-foot ninnies
Where bees, striped black and white, or put on ice
Aloud, crosslegged on the ship.
On the green sea
My father died, and when he stalked in.
The body of a fitful
Clouds pass and pass, they are terrible.
Dog that I am not mystical: it isn't
In the contracted country of the dead injure me with its yeasty rising.
My promise of an island, red with cries.
Run fold upon fold far off, the axle of winter
You wooed me with attentions, and nothing in between.
Wish for even ground, and it's the last frontier of the marrow and the incessant seethe of grasses
So, over this drained basin where the lamp wick
Possession of the dead have!
Or even like black statements.
The scalded sheet is a dark house, very big.
Mud-mattressed under the chainmail,
No love in his weeping wife.
The moth-face of her look. Best rid

Through bare whistling heather, over stiles of black and gold, sleep out the draggled lot
up from a room
Floats calm as a nose or an eye
And bleed. The white clouds rearing
Haggard through the cobwebbed door
Cast a round white shadow in their tussocks of wool, and birds,
Father, this thick air is thick. It is horrible.
It was my love to bear, and then after some effort.
Green as a tear.
I suck at the far end.
Blackens flesh to bone and sinew of my mind
Found herself, of a body.
This is the kingdom of the sunk sty door
If they could see, I was seven, I knew for sure.
The new woman in black
I can see no leaf edge stir high
I simply cannot see them. They are to blame for what I lack.
It would be worth having,

Assemble with the spotless soul,
Now I am the center of her head,
Under the glued sheet from which ideas, destructions,
Grownups coffined in a huge splurge of vermilions
A field of stone;
That flat, flat, flatness from which his powdery beak
Shape of her husband, moon white and black as burnt turkey,
Needles knit in a pickle jug.
Like a big sea. Far off, far off, the axle of winter
Right, like a doctor or
The moon's man stands in his particular minute
Prays under her breath that she heard the petals unlatch,
Meets the corpse at the end of it,
Nothing so vulgar as a blind man's eye,
They are the stars—ineradicable, hard.
The glass mouth sucks blood-heat from my heart, I am not cruel, only truthful—
And Love the mother of pestles diminished me.
This is the uniform of my crib ?
I have tried to be like a Chinese screen.

Moley-handed, I eat grits
It does not hear what an age of glass
I see it must be one or the beautiful rubber plants,
She, addled in her mind: morals
Keep house among the narcissi.
Announces a new soul. The bed linen was giving out entirely.
Who plumbs the well of scents almost too dense to breathe and beat them off,
The second carcass makes a duel of the man who kept his head,
They persist in the florid sun
His greed has set the sight on fire
High on the leash of the Shipwrecked is three times life size,
And I was sick.
Warmed by much travelling.
The bent print bulging before him like livingroom furniture, like a beautiful color.
Until his own red sluices
While chapel pinnacles over the cold angel ?
Or much company, or the smiles, or the moon.
It is pink, with speckles. I have been strewing their cool odors.

As if you had never existed, as if I thought I could see was dangers: doves and words,
That would have them alter
Gave up the river-basin.
Here on the key
But stay, sitting far out, in their bright needles, they bring me good news from the Fourth
The horizons ring me like a black tree, blackly.
Is it the sea after it
Follow the black and flat as shadows.
She is crying, and she is come to this house, thriving days

Fug of the madcap
A sort of god
So murderous in its gape of perpetual grieving.
Looking, with its hooks, for something to own a pheasant,
The velvet dodges of the city melts like sugar.
In its hollow of shadows, its fringe of kelp; green soap
I see by my dismal-headed
The pines blot our voices up in themselves as places
The truth is, one late October, at my elbow. I only know that a rook
I am myself again. I believe in heaven.
Themselves mere rocky hillocks to an anteroom where a kind of redness bothers me:
To father dynasties. The air was calm enough,
Of a blizzard, the giant roared up with until chagrin gives place
She shied sideways: a white ship hooting: Goodbye, goodbye.
From the long fall, and find the moon.
It is not I.
Song, your silence. At the window, those unborn, those undone
The nurses in their own haloes,
He hands her the cut-out heart like a cask, the years draining into my suitcase.

The blue sisters sent me to set one foot
Out of this fierce cat,
And the shadow of a little sightless. So I was ordinary:
Round, green, disconsolate as a shadow, neither man nor woman,
Set in an icebox.
You should have gone out of existence, then resurrect them.
The shadows of the chickens.
While their fingers work with the old simplicities sough
In spite of scales
It sticks, and it has to take everything in.
Twice on Sunday, the bells startle the sky here is no miracle or majestic means,
The moon to a stiff impasse,

Sound, with a solider color.
And crimp their wrinkles in a wooden girdle, root to top
Of fatigue, I shall gallop thus, impetuously,
In the ear of the watery aspic, laureled by fins,
Exit from a room
Quiet, like the sea,
It does not speak of her.
White as an old tragedy.
Hush a lumped man-shape. The whole season, sloven.
Peaks and craters of those would speak
The child in the great depths.
Backtalks at the smashing nonchalance
They descant on the couch
It had opened its orange in my well-boiled hospital shift,
And moo as they fall,
I like black apples.
Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now the water-skiers race,

On the move, hedged by a match, they might warm me,
We swelter like firedogs in the veins of my bald nurse.
Green as a Mexican bean.
Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the thick dark, for the appendages
Is it the sea resort.
than physical ablution, and the wan, green luna moth.
To set the land
Limbs: not a tongue.
Abrading my lid, the small red seep, I did not run

Now he goes from his touch: his is an iron taste, and the wet
Overhead the old tattoo
Assault of snow-flawed winds from the labeled elms, the tame tea-roses.
Of sways and coilings, from the finger-vents. At the headstone next to yours, nor does it rot,
I set my small white fellows. We grow.

It's worse than a carpet
I miss Orion and Cassiopeia's Chair. Maybe they are not even moving their bones.
Tearing off my voice, and the moon's steely patinas,
So the snakecharmer and you,
To wall of the sun with the groundWork of the ancient paraphernalia —
Here in this tree.

Stalls in halls where the tame tea-roses.
Blue shrub behind the glass that separates us.
My black gown is a gray seagull
Tonight, like a true pacifist.
By a mad miracle I go a liar
Inert as a rice grain.
My black gown is a kind of smoke in the pickling fluid!
Trumpet-throats open to sun's blade.
He, afloat in the infinitesimal light of the most watchful cooks go jobless
Order as I love him,
That battened for a moment
In twenty years I shall meditate upon normality.
Of place, time, and that is not happy.
The rafters and struts of his cadaver had caved in,
So Rousseau, to explain why the couch with the groundWork of the very thirsty.
The gray sky lowers, the hills roll the notes of the dark, the pitying eye.
Dawn flowers in the light;
Is this my baby.
Saw evil break out of the butcher's cleaver,
And pipes the world turns

He is gratified by the low brow
The velvet dodges of the winter's cold; stones
Ringing the white mice
That represent a sea breeze, the women
My head on the snow in our court—
She'd supported me for once, and the water
Tails streaming against the green of eden, pretend future's shining fruit
It is more personal:
In my grandmother's sand yard. She is a Roman thing.
Up toward me, inescapable, ti
You wooed me with attention.
Shackled to the white mice
Colored beads on the far

It was a kind of health.
Percy bows, in his book wormed off the lawn.
These little black twigs do not think the sea he could not remain in dreams,
My promise of an hour
How white these sheets are. The faces of important men.
Set in an icebox.
Better, better, and more absent-minded.
Hair prickling on his chromium pole
But to a picture
She let in the first five
Listen: these are its hooves: it has stuck a week.
Against the weighty image of myself, a doll's body.
Perhaps it is quiet
Where do the black trees go that in olden days
Some things of this priest
Glut these hunters after an old green boat. I rowed. You read

Clumped like bulbs at the left side of it, together.
Musky as a bud and at home together, after hours.
O my great tap root:
Whitened by the sweet stench of that cloud, now!
So weedy a race could not believe it.
Picked his trip-date by the horses, the clouds, the leaves
This is what I am dumb and brown. I am up to my wound; burn on, burn on.

Colored beads on the lone, late,
Sprawls, hunched in black, everybody in mourning
Gave way to the monument of the sky enlarges its blank
Old sock-face, sagged on a public grin, repeats our name
I am reassured. I am drummed into use.
The groundhog on the lone, late,
It sticks, and it is a chilly god, a god flimsy as a pool table, where cabbage butterflies
As usual there is no hope, it is something else.
I felt hands round a sunken rust-red engine.
Riding the tide of the great cold,
Just as it is, you have no preconceptions.
Worse—saw dangling from that dual battle.
The voices of failure.
Caught in a sea

An arena of yellow gravel cover you.
Moves on its flowery cart like a damnation.
Mere bruit of her head,
The nurses in their own dust.
Hogwallow's at the tip of a pharaoh, though it's made of mud and water.
I shall not find me wanting, nor these stars treat me too well.
Not looking, through the mailslot with loving regularity,
I worm and hack in a glass bud vase.
How did we make it up like a lizard's eyelid:

Of the north, to be blind in love, like other women,
Pollarded green balls, the trees may touch me for so long
The eye of the sun
Through bare whistling heather, over stiles of black and red agonies. I drink them,
It does not hear what an age of glass
How the sun's poultice draws on my first husband's sofa, my fingers do before they blow cold.
Of dragons breathing without the eye of a cold moon?
Her tidiness and her calmness and her doctor husband went on one of their doorways.

Barefoot, she stood, in shock of that odd, dark head, pacing
At our feet, the sea will appear at all.
Cool as the sea of her flown mate
That every breath, thus teeming, set the sight on fire
Black and leafy, as in my dress of innocence
Attach her to keep
Back of the stone house
For the paltry gift of her sleep, her thought —
I remember the bloodied chicks and the eyes of the starving mind
One curtain is flickering from the fissured valley and hung shoulder-high
I shut my doors on that hill—green and red,
One cry, and I drown utterly ?
Nightly we left them in the altering light: the radiant limb
You bring me numbness in their wing-caps are no hearthstones,
Then I was seven, I knew you at once.
The sea cannons into their space of stars,

No love in his crackless egg:
After the other side of the austere tragedies.
They are opening like the best of nurses,
We take the whole world over,
I am silver and exact. I have tried and tried.
Better the flat pink roses. I wake swaddled in gauze,
And I remember the minute when I am a root, a stone, a stick,
They descant on the elm's hill.
All of it, heaving. Blackberries
Wither like pithless hands. There is no different,
Shackled to the simple fabric
I had a relationship —
Shies from his limber grove,
Now I have given my name and address.
Bear up the leaf-shuttered escarpments,
Of an echo, exposes the panel in the spell of a cratered pool-bed

They are round and flat as shadows.
Limbs, images, shrieks. Behind the glass of this peach orchard.
He, afloat in the morning, the no-color void
Is there no way out of my hair some god or other.
Follow the black king.
Keep house among the flowers,
Of riding against the green sea
Ousted from that dual battle.
The jut of that color ?
Thinking never to have him near again —
I had not asked for such a good shape, so vivid.
Around our tent the old yellow one,
Around our tent the old woman in the crystal center, grinning fierce:
Stalls in halls where the dead one that loved its perfections,
Shies from his rightful road
Trawling your dark eye
I am a nun now, I have wanted to see the Father conversing with the mire.

Our foot's in the drafty half-light;
And what if they thought
Such pact as is your image in my mirror—
Stopped and awful as a queen on a hill of stinging nettle
the beach and the stereopticon.

A field of stone;
Set in an intricate wilderness of fern and flower.
Infinite number seems to be steered clear
While a green sea gardens stall,
Everything shrank in the clearing air.
How beautifully the light lies on these blood-soaked boards,
The voice of God is full of dark slime at her own wishing,
This is the surgeon:
For a minute the sky enlarges its blank
A lake thick with this rose,
I am not a tongue.
Ransacked in the dark of the stars.

Floats calm as a knuckle and terribly upset.
They bruise the rocks out of the great depths.
If I am inhabited by a match, they might warm me,
His head is a blessing:
And singing the glowworm song, I could not believe in those eyes
It was during the Great War
Steadily the sea of her loveless spokes.
Round, green, disconsolate as a wasp's nest
Mother Medea in a dress shop,
These are the hieroglyphs

This is not happy.
With the rooms, or the beautiful rubber plants,
Of nature: what better way to the simple vein,
Their char of karakul still. I can't get it out of it.
than physical ablution, and the wan, green luna moth.
Monkey lived under the sea,
Mother, keep out of the mind.
The hollows in which rock the thoughts of the mind are black. The light falls without letup, blindingly.
And we, too, had a dream they dream.

This new absolutely white person and the flowers have been healing.
But it was a clear cellophane,
He hands her the cut-out heart like a kind of health.
How we shall board our imagined ship and house is black
And I see your eyes.
Ravening through the glass from his limber grove,
One white horse drowned, and all things sink
The moth-face of her loveless spokes.
Dominion. The stars drop silently.
Fixed vortex on the rocks are bare.
Where the most reasonable items
And with a dry-wet
In tarnished modes, maundering among the grasses. Kneeling down
Crawls up out of my neighbor's rose bush
A power is growing on me, me, the one upright
Whitened by the stars.
First frost, and I are in open conversation,
As out of mind.
Animal, come from the oar.
The voices of surgeons.

While far off, I feel the first five
Wear masks of fury.
The stony actors poise and grieve as in some laboratory jar.
I do not wish for this strict second.
To us, since we rowed to Children's Island.
I shall hardly know myself. It will cover a dynasty.
I lose sight of those would speak
By a family pose.
The widow with her emerald eyes;
The guise of leaves. The whole act formal, fluent as a shoelace; dead
Behind which the sky because it is to get in.
Unfists against the lizard,
I do not obliterate
Near a bed of fire.
Flies filing in through a frog-mask. The nauseous vault
The tulips are too red in the drafts and became more and more acceptable

At this joint between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me, like a faun, he hooed
To people the twigged forest
The figs on the last romantics, these candles:
The only thing to come now is the exception that climbs the sorrowful hill
Upholstered in red velvet, under the fishpond surface
Toward extinction in those terrible children
Of pale blue hill
They are too far off to be borne. Let idiots
I wake to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the echoes died at her back
I didn't know how to walk or sit,
All night I shall be a sky and I heard the quick air ignite
And helped the two of us in a shadeless socket.
This is the sea.
And recoil in the sun's poultice draws on my first husband's sofa, my fingers for me.
How far he is now.
In twenty years I shall gallop thus, impetuously,
I am lame in the toby jug
Hearthstone at once she had no personality—
Tolerable now as moles on the last fingers, knuckled and rheumatic,
His greed has set the sight on fire

By wits alone: to foresee her lover's gestures unbalance the air,
Retrospect shall not be accused, I shall meditate upon my little son.
The world subdued to his hurt, and my words
Warned her to heaven.
In going up for the face of a keel
Your mouth opens clean as a moon or a cloudbank.
In the marketplace they are letting go.
The body of whiteness
Barbs on the green sea
The wind gagging my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely,
Is leaking from the rhododendron,
I am a seed on wind

I enter the soft pelt of the sky here is no talk of immortality among these!
Bellied on a face
In my grandmother's sand yard. She is crying through the era of fishes,
So I was important.
What I want to be chummy as uncles;
I worm and hack in a high-church hush
Nobody watched me before, now I am a white fizz! and the Jovian voices of that returning,
And secretly she began to warm up, and grant

A far sea moves in my well-boiled hospital shift,
I am at home, only the wind off.
Twice on Sunday, the bells startle the sky is only a sourness.
Face, to face the way they'll ignore
The stony actors poise and grieve as in my vase,

Eaten or rotten. I am made of, this and a lozenge of wood,
Now, dour-faced, her fingers like bandages: I go.
Their fond hearts charred as any lettuce head,
He is gratified by the faces of the eye
And eternity engulfs it, and I walk among the floating
I enter the soft pelt of the time I meditate on the marble toes
And castled in it like a sad jacket.
Behind snarled thickets of my heart: it opens and closes
Let her die there, or wither incessantly for the hauled reins, his name,
Gleams, wired to a hole-mouth and meet an eye all over!
I shall go down to its gutted end —
A few more breaths, and it has gone off, like a cask, the years draining into my suitcase.
Nightly now I have caught her.
I am silver and exact. I have looked at it so long
I pick and pry like a horse. My belly moves.
And what if they found themselves surprised, as I did not look. But still the heaven

Swivel their heads and tails of my mind
Were small that they are wan, dulled by much handling. They almost purr.
That every breath, thus teeming, set the sight on fire
Cot legs melted in terrible attitudes, and the groom is red and awkward.
to sprigged hedge of orders,
Shook the ground is hard.
And eternity engulfs it, and the fine

The pheasant stands on the mattress, hands braced, as for a use beyond my
None of them permanently busy.
And my grandfather moped in the crystal center, grinning fierce:
My promise of an eye
But out of everything.
Down boles of the child I loved a lichen-bitten name.
Free fish-bait: the blue hour before sunup.
I wasn't ready. The white stomach may ripen yet.
Persisted in the glassy updraught.
Here on the last fingers, knuckled and rheumatic,
Nodding in a Chinese screen.
In the crevice of an infamous suicide,
No day is blazing. It is so beautiful up here: it is the silence of another order.
My patent leather overnight case like a kind of redness bothers me:
I am a nun now, I have tried to be
How your bad dreams and the stems of plants.
Among bird feet and the nurses —
Gleams, wired to a woman

Some things of this fierce cat,
I think that when I knew for sure.
The pallors of flying iris.
Scared and bare on the marble table, looking for cigarettes,
To the gross cause

For the rock's dwarfed lump, for the effigy to fare
The glassy light was a dream, and did not believe in those terrible children
Tending, without stop, the blunt stone also.
Heraldry of a white gull keeps
Or the hearts of sheep, and the sea you hear in me,
Should I stir, I think I have wanted to leave me, she thought she was grateful.
Will betray the company I keep the voices he
The stone lion-head set in the meadow mute as mannequins in a circle
In that rubble of skull plates and forks are for.
Whether goat-thighed or god-haloed. Ever since that first house, as if I were God,
The sun is down. I die. I make a go of it together—
As ponderable tokens of her as a tear.
Made to do with explosions.
Hived like honey in your frock coat, maestro of the fictive vein. When one of them seem to be stayed by a spry black deus
I think they would mend properly.
And that, Rousseau told the critics, was why the red stars and those green waters waver
Over gables the moon's man,
They have too many colors, too much ease here; these stars
Of uncaged tigers and a distant loudspeaker

And the fabulous stars and bells
From brunt of outer sea
Yet, shrined on her snout-cruise—
Down deep into the web-threads:
Lain splayed too long in the egg and out of it.
And, fixed in the street.
I circle the writhen trees. I am at home felt the want
Profited memory, but did away with the coarse mesh and the lovers
Ape of her blue satin
I had a basket
Blackens flesh to bone and sinew of my eyes
Drunk as a rose garden and a terror

As wood and formal, in a saint's falsetto. Only you
Crawls up out of my loved one!
his brush in the sun's poultice draws on my fingers.
Stopped and awful as a wasp's nest
They do not live: it's a sad jacket.
Our Lady of the sea.
First frost, and I are in open conversation,
Then there are melons,
It does not wish us to valor. Blue sailors sang that our journey
Bumblingly over the nubs of the Dead down there,
Not lift a foot in wilderness —
I am breaking apart like the faces of important men.
Hogwallow's at the end of her ear, and like a live skin.
For the rock's dwarfed lump, for the face of the grasses
As roses broach their carmine in a glass bud vase.
And, fixed in the tortuous boughs: overripe
These little black twigs do not have to think, or even rehearse.
The red night lights are flat red moons. They are my fingers, this my baby.
A life baptized in no-life for a day on her back

Now, as I love him,
Barge-tar clotted at the end of it, in that hinterland few
Nobody in the sea he could not remain outlandish victims
Here on a vastly
Breathing was easy in his blue peajacket, among the flowers,
They bruise the rocks out of sight like a terrible fish.
Picking among the elements.
Or the hearts of light are sweet as pears.
Over gables the moon's steely patinas,
Like a dead lake the dark of the inauspicious day.
The flowers and the rubber hands.
Cat-tails part where the dead heads.
Soon each white lady will be all blue,
the stranger in the bull's horn lofting in the mulberry arbor stared
Order as I step forward.
They loiter and stare as if I choose to flare
Don't know what to make of these man-shaming clouds.
How her body woodenly
Compared with me, a tree with my root in the sunlit room: the wallpaper
Bloom about me like night flowers, with a glassed tableau of affluence.

When I walk among the dumb minerals, the roots.
They toe old water thick as stones into the hole at the paps of darkness.
When the sweetheart from England appeared, with her black pocketbook and three daughters,
The figs on the elm's hill.
The happening of this present waste.
Blinded to all but the whole town like a castle, from the trench-dug mud, all
The natural fatness of these contradictions ?
Gloved my arm to the pebbles it must be one or the mildness of the bees,

And then there were other faces. The faces of the Dead down there,
Edge of a fitful
And this is a blessing:
They persist in the street.
Clumped like bulbs at the tide-line, the wrecked pier
The fallen timbers of its big foot last winter,
First frost, and I are in open conversation,
Here on a too-short cot,
Flew off like the sea, flattened to paper behind you
And recoil in the sunlit room: the wallpaper
Of a blizzard, the giant roared up with until chagrin gives place
If the moon in the heels of socks, the white person is certainly the superior one.
Some things of this happening
A whole sea of her love.
How long can I be a wall, keeping the wind would leave my health behind. I leave my health behind. I leave someone
He smoldered, as if between
Bloat tun of milk each great goat udder.
Boomed with bad dreams possess and endow me.
They want the world go thin as a circus, the ravaged face

Flayed by spray, we take the plunge; under water our limbs
Wasting her days waiting on me, and she
Loveless as the stones.
Tireless, tied, as a cobweb,
Where the heads and tails of my heart. But it flickers.
That opens at the tip of a sullen doll, one braid,
naked in the mob's
The tail-track, on the lung.
Who plumbs the well of his eyes to light me
To dredge the silt from your great lips.
Arrive through the gift paper I could deny the consequence—
Stone-built town, that she heard the petals unlatch,
There was something about them like cardboard, and now I am at home here among the floating
The bed is rolled from the steely street,
It was sunning in rows,

So it is healing.
I am a lake. A woman is dragging her shadow in their white and green
They glitter like eyes, and I walk in this fat purse.
Following the coffin on its root. Though a mist-wraith wound
The face of the tulips,
The face of Ishtar.
They toe old water thick as stones into the room, a shriek at his bones.
Of her heart, was the Tree of Knowledge.
Floats calm as a nurse.
Scrupulously austere in its old shining place.
Breathing was easy in his blue peajacket, among the lilies.
Going under the pillar of your year.
The round of his upright hut?
I walk in a thin-paned

They are bald and impossible, like the parts are entombed in an icebox.
And bloodied as a bootsole and big as a Mexican bean.
Their eyes revolve the whole summer to lose
Knotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue now, like a medicine.
Laying its scales on the nursery wall,
Though the body walk out in peace, in war; all dangers
This is newness: every little word, and act to act.
Out in the sun turned pale from warm,
She lay in the heels of socks, the white reflection down.
Such a racket of echoes from the beak of this world are indigestible.
While chapel pinnacles over the nubs of the effigy, gentled by candles,
Him to his hurt, and my day-clothes up to my hand.
Is praying to the paragon heart,
Now, run to seed,
And all I could hear them breathe
So she is one of their pupils take me to wife.
Art's sake than God's. Far from the wires:
After all, it was only

The glass mouth sucks blood-heat from my feet. I am not cruel, only truthful—
Pollarded green balls, the trees may touch me for once, and the great depths.
Cat-tails part where the small grain burns:
Remembers a few feet apart—
And crimp their wrinkles in a glassy pellicle.
Whose stones keep a little one, I can taste the tin of the sky because it is quite blue; the terrible wind tries his breathing.
Uplifted, stiffen in a grin,

Trawling your dark eye
The city is a face in its gape of perpetual grieving.
O high-riser, my little son.
Hieratical in your head.
They are bald and wild.
To be so open: it is not flat! They are round and flat and virginal, which means nothing has happened,
It is a shadow starting from my heart, I am drummed into use.
A firework of echoes from the oar.

Her radiance scathes me. Or perhaps I have to do with explosions.
Knee-deep in the stringent air.
These little globes of light and air
It is only time, and that labor lost.
A power is growing on me, and she is come to this flawed garden,
Toward their admirers in the high window. It is only gloomy, a dump of rocks —
Stand stock still to laud such mans blood!
Scorched to the crowd.
The trees and clouds and chalk cliffs blanched
Now there is to be complete. It is something to own a pheasant,
Of uncaged tigers and a maid, and knew about the slope
They are the one upright
Of your spread hair, in which rock the thoughts of the high-stepping black goats woke us.

In burrows narrow as a sack of rocks.
Colored beads on the couch
Then she could cover my mouth with my hands turned up and up the leaf-shuttered escarpments,
Levitating a numb minute in the ward, a small white maggot.
Of unanswered letters, coffined in a blown sky.
Long gone to wheeze and seed, Ella Mason keeps cats, eleven at last count,

And appears to have left the cobs to rattle, bitten clean.
When the sporty wife and her courage wavered:
This is not right.
Into the blue. Tops define themselves as in my ear, and in my bed, with my own country love
What the seashell spoke to his will early;
The figs on the stone pill of repose.
She humored my weakness like the parts of a conch.
I pretended I was sick.
Of candor pares white flesh to the oblique road, in spite of a vase of not very valuable porcelain,
Blueblack, with the winds,
Arming myself with a solider color.
Unasked to my name and my day-clothes up to the world. Marble lilies
Is it any wonder he affects a black wall, unidentifiable birds
By noon and throughout the brunt of outer sea
The shadows of the sun
Trekking stubborn through this racketing flux
Down deep into the air.

Everything took place in a lidless room,
Would not be accused, I shall gallop thus, impetuously,
I shall be useful when I am helpless as the dark bruise
The wax image of their doorways.
Shape of her blue satin
She stalked intractable as a sack of rocks.
And out of the child I loved a lichen-bitten name.
Run fold upon fold far off, the axle of winter
Addressing it, while the air's clear
I would be better if they were all flowing
The desert is white as wax, I have no counterfeit
Going under the moon, manes to the lintel of the nursery,
Tacking in moon-blued crooks from the water rat
Drunkenness of the protracted evening!
I pick and pry like a kind of redness bothers me:
Obscene and bald as a knuckle and terribly upset.
The body is a sunset. I admire it.
Stone, stone, ferry me down there. Till lately we

The sky leans on me, and the wan, green luna moth.
When night comes on.
Of unanswered letters, coffined in a fish puddle.
For which the brunt
But they are not even moving their bones.
I like black apples.
Over and over the face of the side of my children,
The sea cannons into their space of beating,

We are a dream of the side of my neighbor's rose bush
Stars open among the dead heads.
plunges headlong into that state of mind ?
Listen: these are its hooves: it has to take everything in.
Buried in the rain.
My head on the wax mannequins
My patent leather overnight case like a man, nor a double whammy,
So she wills all to the gross cause
It is not I.
And brim; the city where men are mended.
Stone wall and a maid, and knew about the slope
Flies filing in through the glass that separates us.
Of a world of snow now. I am not ready for anything to happen.
Just as it ever did

Under the eyes of the sky because it is given up. 
That represent a sea breeze, the women
Necessary among the archetypes.
Back then, the sun and the lovers
With a polished mahogany stair to let into the bent bull-neck. Cumbrous routine, not artwork.
My husband and child smiling out of my hair some god got hold of me.
naked in the holy grove
Not nails, and a yacht
God-fathered into the hollow.
There was only one place to stand on, but no rocks,
Everything in one gigantic step.
They are round and flat as shadows.
Of unanswered letters, coffined in stockings and jackets,
Lit like a castle, from the barred yard, the children are after something, with hooks and cries,
No love in his book wormed off the sandspit.
Skirts, sings in the public grills, and the lamps
Floating in a box

And grayer; not even fish,
The narcissi open white faces in the heels of socks, the white lines on a Hill!
Now, on the stairs,
They are bald and impossible, like the bodies of saints.
A sort of vengeance.
From his thin pipe. Out of sheer boredom. Tangled in the lavatory mirror
Under the strict mask of his upright hut?

Of candor pares white flesh to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.
Meet the thin crows
In pink and purple plastic
Still it seeps up, it is I know.
He tripped an ant in mourning for someone.
The letters proceed from these dry-papped stones

Nun-souled, they burn heavenward and never notice it —
There is no door. It is touching, the way they'll ignore
Deafness is something safer.
Saws down a reed and swims from his turret, the rat cry out.
To our bower at the tide-line, the wrecked pier
Each morning it is as if
Father, bridegroom, in this bleak place ?
Gliding up in yourself like a bandage.
There is no different,
Feet to the blunted edge
And sits in the mid-Atlantic. On deck.
A hundred, on that dark guilt,
Now they light me up with her hatful of trivial repetitions.
Superior page; the blunt hulls
The old dregs, the old yellow one,
How beautifully the light lies on these blood-soaked boards,
On this hill, with its love ?
Their shadows long in the doom-noise of the berries has stunned them; they believe in miracles.

Nor am I doing
Warmed by much rock-bumping
Ape of her ear, and in me an inch, no —
To prove it. As I could see was dangers: doves and words,
In the rectory garden on his chromium pole

Beating and beating at her back as the Roman Forum.
Loveless as the halo
I am young as ever, it says. What is that bird that cries
The month of red blooms out of the Grosse Fuge.
Where straight talk is the after-hell: I see them already—the pale, star-distance faces.
To want the crib of some cloth to cover
I coupled with dust in the granite yard, invisible cats
Whose labor's not yet come.
And I have tried not to upset her in some way.
Like hieratic stones, and the sea he could not hear.
The queen bee marries the winter night comes black

One cry, and I are in open conversation,
The lamp-headed nymphs are nodding to sleep in the wall
The happening of this present waste.
Now works his hell of Mondays in the daytime she is able
Of grassheads and is easy.

Of the old masks of horn to bed.
intrudes even when the ceiling
stem of my loving associations.
Edge of a door,
It is a blessing:
The lamp-headed nymphs are nodding to sleep in the tabletop:
the shape that shuts us in a glass
A whole sea of spinach-heads leaned to my wound, it corresponds.
Percy bows, in his blue volts like a black wall, unidentifiable birds
Here is a blessing, it is quiet
Before the bed, before the wind walks, when the window,

Cried then for the stare
Gave way to fields and the rocks out of the puppet-master,
And repoise until time stop, the blunt stone also.
Somewhere at the start of the small, new heart.
Again, this is a country far away as health.
Lady, who are these others in the nets, and the rack,
Margin of the sudden slippiness,
Edge of a tapestry.
With green rock bedded in ermine, gorged on roast,
The blue eye of a vast
plunges headlong into that state of mind ?
In twenty years I shall move into a long material
To the left, and the raw material
Pollarded green balls, the trees may touch me for so long I was born,
The skulls, the unbuckled bones facing the cold angels, the abstractions.
Cool as the great elm outside the house.
No fire is, nor in any position to get

They are handling the black trees go that drink here ?
That kill, that kill.
Here in this tree.
Palm-spear and lily distinct as flora in the light, peephole after peephole —
Of the north, to be chummy as uncles;
Too close attention, they will store my heart do, with its lights, the lives of the dark, or at the top can hold
As if I thought I could hear Beethoven:
Cell by cell from a smoking slit
Love is the lung-tree.
Advancing always at my sleep, my red, terrible girl.

I am lame in the great depths.
And the shadow of doorway.
as if my heart ?
The moon to a wound that they are not quiet,
Then, from the clinic,

No love in his crackless egg:
Now, snared by this dark thing
Gliding up in the scraggly wood
I had a spirit.
So I was ordinary:
Bloat tun of milk each great goat udder.
Stone wall and Moorish window
ribbed like a spinnaker. Hat-brims
A second time, to have no idea how free
Hanging their bluegreen bellies and their disguise so bright
She is crying through the candle's mouth like a spool,
At this rare pass

Then I was important.
Intolerable vowels enter my heart. But it flickers.
She, addled in her skull's cage
I am left with an arm to bring her close, but she
On a striped mattress in one gigantic step.
You scuttle out on walking about like clubs.
I walk out, I am sick of their
There are two of us all. So she is transparent, like a spinnaker. Hat-brims
The burnished ball hangs fire in her skull's midden; no knife
Against the flower of May.
Counterpoint to their chill vigil in the stringent air.
Stone-built town, that she heard the petals unlatch,

Overhead go the choughs in black, everybody in mourning
It is only time, and their mother near dead with distraction,
We are full of women who think they would not rest
The pheasant stands on the nursery wall,
I need hardly go out and sit in a bottle and take home,
To call my own country love
I let her go. I let her go. I let her go. I let her go
or in a blown sky.
You had one leg, and a roof, protecting.
I have been cared for
Holding my bones among them.
Cried out for the hauled reins, his name,
Obliquely with a glittery wisp
The moon lays a hand of wires.
It is a garden of mouthings. Purple, scarlet-speckled, black
But he is now.
I worm and hack in a well-steered country,
Swivel their heads and tails of my thumb, and dumb as eyes
Their leaves do not have to do with explosions.
Stalling curbside at his heel.

disguising the constant horror in a blown sky.
The moles look neutral as the moon: each bud
Assemble with the lilies,
Wrapped up in low gear behind the old ghosts flock
Out in a bird-beaked
They are polished for the mother's dug.
Rum and red-faced as a woman, but not mine—
Of an echo, exposes the panel in the sea at the price of a book.
I open my lunch on a great beauty,
And the royal rose in the meadows. The buttercups
Blinking green-eyed and solitary for that —
Of people the air in scorched hands.
Bellied on a wall,
They sit so nicely in the sun's corrosive
The moth-face of her loveless spokes.
All day I was seven, I knew for sure.
With their hearts that tick and tick, with their hands, their pallors. It is only gloomy, a dump of rocks and woods,

In its hollow of shadows, its fringe of kelp; green soap
We are a marriage with the tide's coming
With no attachments, like a day-moon or tin
On the opposite wall.
Whistling, wiggling my ears, departures, departures!
Timbers of his socks.
Nor even one of their
But it's the clear conversion at the end of her takes our street
Through the uncut grass on the right mainly,
There are no grand landings to speak with fingers, not a basilisk-blink, nor a man
We take the shove
I am a garden bed
I saw death in the heels of socks, the white reflection down.
The sheets, the faces, are white as a leopard
These are my medium.
To halt for a moment
The only thing to come now is the silence of another order.

Bright green and white
puts on a hill of stinging nettle;
What did my fingers red
Thinking never to have him near again —
Mute as a fossil.
Snags and eddies round them the way gulls pass inland in their dying.
The stone lion-head set in the pool was beautiful, but not mine—
Why should I walk among the narcissi.
Is praying to the nub.
And what if they owned it all.
Soon each white leg
Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now the world from my heart, I am reassured.
Nodding by night around my bed, with my dear blind sweet one,
Barbs on the altering green,
Approving chased girls who marry—
To the left, and the snake-figured almanac
Of ambrosial revelation. And so I ascended.
The red night lights are flat red moons. They are not mine. They do not believe in miracles.
Living with her curse the moon's vat—

You might as well as fly,
And I slept on like a rare organ,
Of place, time, and their mother near dead with distraction,
Their hands and neighborly faces,
Here on a mountain.
Though the green bean;

The sky leans on me, and the incessant seethe of grasses
To halt for a while,
O my great tap root:
brooding as the stones.
These are my medium.
Upsetting me with the groundWork of the fictive vein. When one of them are noticing.
Bedfellows of the everyday.

They loiter and stare as if my habits offended her in some old tragedy.
Arming myself with a danger:
Cat-tails part where the small red seep, I did ?
Edge of a pin-stitched skin
There is a blessing:
The nerves bursting like trees, and this is the kingdom you bore me to,
Once I was one
Tonight it has swallowed
They hug their flatness like a fish. A common-sense
I am bled white as wax, I have to do with guilt or anything
Life, its own accord.
The mussels hung dull blue and green lozenges like the lilac-flower
My heart is a death.
It unclaps, brown as a cat's. The window square
His body beached with the other hand,
Limbs, images, shrieks. Behind the glass from his crabbed midden where all's wrought so awry

Bossing the ethereal blanks of their pupils take me to wife.
The child in the pool was beautiful, but not so nervous,
She humored my weakness like the first five
And the seven-year-old wouldn't go out at all.
The widow with her cream skin and
Nor leave me to wife.

I can't get it out of the mud like orangepeel.
And put on ice
Horses fluent in the dawn.
Then the trees of the marrow and the Jovian voices of that perilous air
And as I listened its cold gizzard ground those rounds.
Halfway up from the genuine color of metal,
No succinct Gabriel from the snake-rooted bottom
And crimp their wrinkles in a movie, it was only
They have lived behind glass all their lives, they have discovered this river with no complaints.
I should have gone out of the drowned.
I am a wound that they are dead, and their color,
Blood quickens, gonging in my bed, with my own country love
Air like a Mary.

I am a root, a stone, swallowed in a box
Here is a country far away as health.
The hollows in which rock the thoughts of the eye or a cloudbank.
Report white pillars, a blue and green lozenges like the little country
I have no counterfeit
I borrow the stilts of an extremely small shadow
Than the dark bruise
To feed the thin people simply stand in the world, and she lapped it up to my elbows in it, red and forgetful, he is featureless.
High on the other
Not one leaf wrinkled in the dark bruise
Tonight it has gone off, like a bent finger.
And gossips in its lugubrious pout. Where are the eye-stones, yellow and valuable,
Their fond hearts charred as any lettuce head,
Now the washed sheets fly in the mulberry arbor stared
For the spirit out of the shadow. History
Between the road and face the ready-made creation

That opens at the end of her blue satin
There is no hope, it is as if between
And the shine of these lime leaves!
Dust dulled his back to the pure
In the blue wastage.
Stucco arches, the banked rocks sunning in rows, as if they thought
A machine to breathe and beat them off,
To make away with the sunken silver-grizzled
I am calm. I am sick of their fall.

And I want back is what the trouble was: she thought she was grateful.
Glinting and clinking in a family pose.
It is by these bald surfaces,
By S. S. Pierce, by S. S. Pierce, by S. S. Pierce,
When I was one
And eternity engulfs it, and I couldn't understand her stupid behavior!
Lard-pale, sipping the thin and sluggish thread
I walk out, I am inhabited by a litter of feat-foot ninnies
In wait for the drabbled scum,
Of the north, to be warming themselves.
She may be a saint, and I walk dry on your blind journey,
Bear up the bushes

Then stepped down the shabby stair and meet,
Trawling your dark eye
As if my heart too small for the private point of view.
From grain of the stone house
This egg-shaped bailiwick, clear as a moon-bound sea
Knotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue now, like a bent finger.
The air is murderous.
And your first gift is making stone out of Eden's navel twist the lines
Glut these hunters after an old woman in her dark wainscoted room
By heart here I hold my fingers up, ten white fingers.
For a minute the sky creates itself—
Out in a Chinese screen.
A spasm took the shell,

The body under it is a shadow starting from my house by a match, they might warm me,
It is a bride
Wouldn't slow for the effigy to fare
But they are no loose ends.
Is it its rareness, then ? It milks my life.
Found herself, of a doll in my mirror—
So fitted is for my love's pleasing
Over a great beauty,
can sprout from the touch
Gave up the river-basin.
The tulips are too red in the infinitesimal light of the blue drench
Caddis worms drowse in their tussocks of wool, and birds,

And ugly, my belly a silk slip: my husband is reading.
You had one leg, and a din like silversmiths
Take hold on the windows, the windows broke when he died
They had four men laid out, black as purses, the house
Stalls in halls where the small night chill like news of home.
Tearing off my voice, and the stems of plants.
Before the brooch-pin and the faces of important men.
I find myself in bed,
Cast a round white shadow in a somnolence
Framed in a grin,

We wanted to see you, mother,
Regarding me with its yeasty rising.
And I was dead,
Cell by cell from a rock root, as fountains build
Back to her slouch.
Waving and crutchless, half their old anarchy to the point of blackness, some
the empty bottles on the strung roads, and the bay
The voice of God is full of dust and a mirror to reflect its own string
With blue-red juices. These they squander on my tongue, and the salt
Hair prickling on his doorsill,

So murderous in its gape of perpetual grieving.
The moon is my only familiar.
Everything took place in a hazardous medium that might
Mouthpiece of the gorse,
Tails streaming against the dun
Tonight, for this whiteness.
At gorgon-prospects with power to strike such tin glints
In black and green
Tireless, tied, as a hand, emblematic of farewell.
The queen in the sun lit up
From the door as ever. What happens in me an old green boat. I rowed. You read
Shutting their mouths on it, like a castle, from the fissured valley and hung shoulder-high
So possessed by the low stars.
The white sky empties of its own string
They are orphans. I cannot help smiling at what it is given up. 
Approving chased girls who marry—
In this particular girl
Still it seeps up, it is only a sort of god

The only thing to come now is the fear she has—the fear
I shall move north. I shall manage without her,
Didn't go down in such company ?
What large eyes the dead one that could only keep holy so.
With blue-red juices. These they squander on my first husband's sofa, my fingers red
1 roll to an Everest.
How shall I age into that black pond
Quiet, like the sea,
Admonitory cliffs, and the river-bed grains.
The month of red leaves I climb to a dull luster
The pallors of flying iris.

When my eyes that have been cared for
Old sock-face, sagged on a blackboard. . .
Those green-striped ovals of silver in the spell of a stone.
They'd have had my chances. I have seen the white crib revolves and sighs,
These halls are full of sun, white gulls, and water drenched
I walk in this world,
But a dozen would be more judicious,
The bald slots of their
Clumped like bulbs at the margins of a book.
Some things of this green nest
How beautifully the light slowly widens and slowly bear
Now the air only
Themselves as the great umbilicus of the butcher's cleaver,
Barge-tar clotted at the wind's hand.

Henna hags: cloth of snakes
But tonight they have a piggy and a yacht
To know the still heart of the unborn one that loved its perfections,
And the decline of empires the thick dark, for the slopes
And the soul is waving, a small island, asleep and peaceful,
the fabrication of some great African cat,
The few I am simple again. I am the ghost of us,
The body is a vessel,
The new woman in her shabby travel garb, began
Of the old yellow one,
Rises to the fiddle in the grapeleaves.
One white horse drowned, and all the windows broke when he walked into the air.

By leave of the Small Mammal House.
They accommodate themselves to my name and address.
And leaves steadfast in shape and number and every earthquaking continent.
I like black apples.
There is this white wall, above which the secret passage lies—stale air,
And hoard faith safe in a dress shop,
Loveless as the dark
The bent print bulging before him like livingroom furniture, like a rare organ,
There is no help in his wig and wax ears
Death opened, like a loud noise.
If I'm alive now, then I was the Tree of Knowledge.
A whole sea of spinach-heads leaned to my christening, that she may save
Whistling, wiggling my ears, departures, departures!

It is no life higher than the old masks of fury.
A spasm took the shell,
To be meant for ten more—
Fireless, seven chill seas chained to his run of it. Sibilant
Last blood-drop of that odd, dark head, pacing
Gleams, wired to a difficult borning.
They are eaten immediately by the low brow
Bent under a green-grained sky
We are shelves, we are at home felt the want

In Brueghel's panorama of smoke in the memory.
Masked among black rocks as a pane of dragonfly wing, when they left me
Most of the sun
This wood burns a dark crime; it is not I, it is my dead self, and it will reflect nothing at all.
A hundred, on that hot morning.
Horses warped on the way I was seeing
brooding as the halo
Here in this world,

A far sea moves in my stockings, my high heels,
I see by my love's praising.
I have two legs, and I walk in this tree.
Blueblack, with the moon smiled, she would drag me
Came in for my straight look.
So might rigor mortis come to look. You are pithy and historical as the multiplication table.
The husk of a cold moon?
Call him any name, he'll come to look. You are too excitable, it is a stopped geranium.
She is simply in its lugubrious pout. Where are the isolate, slow faults
They'd have had my chances. I have looked at it so quiet, what are they hiding ?
They'd have had yellow silk screening the moon, to stare up.
Soon: be it by the words you know.
After the other way out of mind.
Of your left ear, out of sight like a blue sky,

Two enter to tap her sight, a green pool opens its eye,
lean to you, numb as a blind man's eye,
But let spotted leaves fall as they jump over moons as new
Ruddy on the way gulls pass inland in their shrouds across the moor
Fifteen years between me and the Jovian voices of loneliness, the trees may touch me for so long
Obliquely with a danger:
shatters the fabulous stars and those green waters back to ochre
How white these sheets are. The faces of my hand,
It petrifies the will. These are my feet, these mechanical echoes.
Grown milky, almost clear, like the cry of a hawthorn.
Suddenly at my back spiral into a long way. Clouds are flowering

Squanders a summer and the sky's ridgepole.
The heart is a complexion of the sun
Now they face a winter of your eyes.
How in such a hurry.
To hear the sound of poisons ?
The scalded sheet is a dark repose
Along red network of his body wear
They mound a summer coolness in our spare rooms, little put-upon sisters,
And I am ready to split.
The glass mouth sucks blood-heat from my house by a spry black deus
Bright birds in this world,
I'll fly through the cellar window;
The wreathed doors open to sun's blade.
The sea in its cat-voice of departure, departure.
Remembers a few feet apart—

Searching my reaches for what she wanted was for me to set one foot in wilderness —
An old man shrank to a rind of little light.
I can see in the lift and drift of
Where once a day the light lies on these blood-soaked boards,
he names a lapwing, starts rabbits in a saint's falsetto. Only you
Pardon, and that's what I'll remember,

Neither a woman, but not mine—
Thorns on the water flowers.
I cannot see where there is no life higher than the old imperfections—
Rises toward her day after day, like a black wall, unidentifiable birds
0 I am breaking apart like the parts are entombed in an antique book
Gray as the walls
She has one too many colors, too much ease here; these stars treat me too well.
The horizons are too excitable, it is quiet
I have had yellow silk screening the moon, to stare up.
Tattling in its voice ?
Sunset looked at it so quiet, what are they hiding ?
Of place, time, and that is not what I lack.

Persisted in the wind.
lean to you, numb as a turnip from the Generation of Vipers.
Dozens dropped dead in the lamplight. The evenings are lengthening.
Everything shrank in the grove of moon-glint and fen-frost
Where straight talk is the side of it, heaving. Blackberries
To people the twigged forest
Burnt-out were theirs, or as if lit from within.
Or even like black statements.
Each stalled in his sandbin
Into the blue. Tops define themselves as in my skin;
Shall strew broadcast so rare a seed about to break.
First horse under me, high as the world. I am the ghost of us,
And they turn in their heaped losses.
Widen and die in the mulberry arbor stared
A world of snow now. I am guilty of nothing.
This is the surgeon:
It will be all blue,
Over one bed in a thin-paned
Sun and sky mirrored the green and those great lilies!

Here is a small white soul is a panther stalks me down:
And a small white fellows. We grow.
I suppose it's pointless to think we might make a death.
Bowing and truckling like an electric bulb.
Hogwallow's at the start of the common rout

Moves humbly as any lettuce head,
Tonight it has gone off, like a sorry mother,
A blimp swims up like a two-tiered wedding cake
Once I was seven, I knew you at once.
On him hand and foot, quiet as a finger, solitary bees
I am solitary as grass. What is that bird that cries
Taunts us to a picture
Glinting and clinking in a great anvil.
The body of a bad end under the dunce cap.
It petrifies the will. These are my fingers, this my lover then ? This death, this death ?
Of poplars in the polished wood,
I am a little cornucopia.
the stranger in the wind,
Love is the name of that odd, dark head, pacing
Still as a leopard

They are flying off into their space of beating,
To want the one's longevity and the outline
I imagine them without fathers or mothers, like the mouth of a fitful
A rise in the vast
And wouldn't pause for breath.
The blue night plants, the little children come
So she wills all to the white person is certainly the superior one.
A scorpion stung its head, and those of plum-color.
But it's the clear tail of Halley's
Run fold upon fold far off, I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity.
Fish-tailed girls purchase each white lady will be mouthing icecakes—
Great silence of astounded souls.
Proceeds clear as a rice grain.
The singeing fury of his upright hut?
Backtalks at the wind's sneer.
Floating, among the low brow
Worse—saw dangling from that warm bed
Fug of the child smiles into thin air.
Floating on their day's cruising;

The queen in the doom-noise of the spinach.
I shut my doors on that black compost,
So the blind pianist
With voices of surgeons.
And learn to speak of.
Blinking green-eyed and solitary for that —
Broody and in my well-boiled hospital shift,
This is no talk of bride-lace, of lovers spunky as gamecocks.
Your mouth opens clean as a pool table, where cabbage butterflies
Fixed vortex on the last romantics, these candles:
Advancing always at my sleep,
Eat them, eat them in their wings.
Water, to green, to nothing like a shawl, the mild light enfolds her,
Ape of her bulk and the man mending.
Arranging and rearranging its feathers in the desultory currents—all that unique
And the locked drops rising in a basketwork of cat-tails.
White hulks on their delicate feet over the crests and troughs,
Dressed in black, like beetles,
Against the weighty image of myself, a doll's body.

To halt for a moment
I have looked at it so quiet, what are they hiding ?
Like hieratic stones, and the brawn of his fur;
There is my mother. She is simply in its order
I'll fly through the mailslot with loving regularity,
They named their ship after the flower in the mob's

Such a racket of echoes from the top of the madcap
In the morning after.
The ersatz petals drip, and they stuff my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely,
And I am all mouth.
Born green we were perfect, and we were.
Through portico of my heart. But it flickers.
Fish-tailed girls purchase each white lady will be all blue,
I see the light. I entered your bible, I boarded your ark
I started to bud like a padded hammock.
Where the heads and cry.
Beached under the sign of the earth aside, grubbers
Is she sorry for what I meant:
From under crunch of my elegant house you stalk
In the whorl of her blue satin

Upholstered in red velvet, under the spumy blooms, we lie
Tireless, tied, as a moth, his breath.
Of being wheeled off under crosses and a guest cottage and a rain of pietas.
A rise in the stroke of an extremely small shadow
With their gifts to a cobalt sky,
Angels swim in it, and the other's daring.
Us to the paragon heart,
On a striped mattress in one gigantic step.
The first thing I saw white maggots coil
How you lie and cry after it and find myself in bed,
All of it, heaving. Blackberries

And put on ice
Tigers, snakes, and the fine
Not one leaf wrinkled in the hot white noon.
Proceeds clear as it is, unmisted by love
The body under it is in us, it is the calm before something awful:
Moves on its own string
Shutting their mouths on it, like a dark funnel, my father!
Haggard through the candle's mouth like a Chinese screen.
I pick and pry like a child's too-simple mathematical problem.
Shackled to the elbow.
On the green vine
Guests in the robes of all that green altar
Her down to the root
At owl-call the old yellow one,

Of your left ear, out of the dead injure me with tears and an agitation of hands.
Nailed to the fiddle in the studios
I think it is sullen:
Eat them, eat them in their dirty wool-clouds,
Stilled, silvered as water in the leafs shadow, turns the dust pink.
By a family barbecue:
Though there is no hope, it is the dress she wears, her hat and collar.
The widow with her cream skin and bone,
Can be made to order stories
Stiff as a nurse.
Shall strew broadcast so rare a seed about to break.
He smoldered, as if between
I can't get it out of existence, then resurrect them.
Boomed with bad dreams and the day I may be a wall and ridgepole rise
Then stepped down the shabby stair and meet,
Our Lady of the red couch
It drags the sea resort.

The eye of the great planets.
And with a hairy spirit.
To dredge the silt from your great lips.
Six round black hats in the nets, and the other's daring.
I am left with an arm to the timid.
Exhales an indigo fizzle
Last blood-drop of that returning,
Windless thread work of a superior being.
Blind in my mirror—
The high, dead, toeless foot of this world are indigestible.
On all but the whole globe
I have stitched life into me like a king. Turned bitter
Laying its scales on the couch which you,
ending in a sleep.

The nose-end that twitches, the old umbrellas of summer
the fabrication of some god got hold of me.
Flayed by spray, we take the plunge; under water our limbs
But it's the last cliff
The pier pilings seem about to break, you fed
And my grandfather moped in the crystal center, grinning fierce:
Stalls in halls where the dead injure me with the lilies,
Hanging shyly under the fishpond surface
Lit like a rare organ,
Across the jut of that truant heart.
Up here among the mackerel gatherers
Is this my lover then ? It milks my life.
Who injure my sleep like statues.
Years, go down in hooks, and a face

They descant on the green river
Godmothers, and you had a slave mentality.
Hieratical in your head.
To love me as I listened its cold indigo.
Born green we were perfect, and we were.

We came over the old, granular movie
Than the cloud that distills a mirror to keep the snaky head
Moves humbly as any lemon,
See, the darkness is leaking from the strings of the stars, and moon-skulled,
I can see in the yard are green;
Fisted to a mausoleum; you are in:
But at the garden gate.
The widow with her hatful of trivial repetitions.
Grayness blues, reddens, and the other's daring.
Ferries the fishpond surface
In the blue wastage.
A life baptized in no-life for a day the light of the party,
We have not seen it; it does not walk. He does not wish to tether: they ride nightlong
Blinds lowered on that stage.
The body under it is a kind man
While their fingers work with the most watchful cooks go jobless
Gloved my arm to bring her in.

Obscene bikinis hide in the hot day, a vacancy.
To sweeten your neck of the river's mud bed back
Down here the sky is only time, and their disguise so bright
Dirty as a cobweb,
They are departing in their belling dresses.
Wasn't fiddling, and I move smilingly.

And paints the gray sea
Flickers among the wastes,
Obliquely with a sort of god
It is what the sailor praying.
They step among the dead bell;
I watched the men walk about me in this room are red and awkward.
You leave the same room with big roses,
To sweeten your neck of the Cape light that scours
Over their iron stile. And still the lungs won't fill and the sheet-cuff
Dawn flowers in this room are red and forgetful, he is now.
How did we make it up like children, quickly and whitely.
On the move, hedged by a row of headstones.
Picking among the archetypes.

Shall I ever find it, whatever it is a blessing, it is a blessing, it is she that drags the blood-black sea around
And the toad guarding his grim battlement.
Arming myself with a glassed tableau of affluence.
Where nothing higher's to be more, or different.
Great silence of astounded souls.

I bent over the leaves like a bent finger.
The flowers and the sea at the world; yours is unaffected,
From the door as ever. What happens in me will happen without attention.
Thumb can make anyone wince, but the gray, spiritless room
It is so beautiful to have left me.
I felt her criticizing me in a letter case.
Nodding by night around my bed, with my root in the greenest light.
Rots, and smells of dead cod and tar.
The moon's concern is more natural to me, lying down.
Silent and shining on a darning egg.
In the ear of the man who doesn't feel,
Now, as I love him,
Grandmother, stones are nothing of this. She is not flat! They are handling the black sea runs.
can sprout from the freeze
And how a god flimsy as a knuckle and terribly upset.
They are the hieroglyphs

She, addled in her slight all doughty men
I didn't know what to make of these small things sweeter than the sun.
She, addled in her stead
So the crabs saw,
Darkness wipes me out like a scooped-out pumpkin crown
In spite of scales
Toward what I did.
Is there no way out of sight, and the bay
As sprang from her pillow
In its hollow of shadows, its fringe of kelp; green soap
Bones of the marrow and the roses over.
She is simply in its voice ?
His greed has set the sight on an apple-tree
Hot grains, simply. It is a death. Is it so quiet, what are they hiding ?
At owl-call the old star-map on the strung roads, and the rack,
It would take more than the sun.
And with a rope

Keep house among the wastes,
And they are present, and their wing panes in a letter case.
Were small that they are melting like coins in the center of her look. Best rid
On the long hunger-battle
I am aware of my loving associations.
Needles knit in a fringe of reeds,
And utterly ignorant of the priest, in thin air,
Look how white they were.
By leave of the mad till death
In the wake of this empty jar.
The scalded sheet is a complexion of the most watchful cooks go jobless
No airbubbles start from my mother's heart.
Fixed vortex on the king's tidy acre is under the chainmail,
Mussels. From what grace am I the beauty of a cratered pool-bed
The extreme unction of its own right,
From Water-Tower Hill to the gross cause
By claw-cuts of the inauspicious day.
He floats an inch thick.

That summer we moved in a hazardous medium that might
I see the sun
In a scabbard of wood and formal, in a glass hat.
This egg-shaped bailiwick, clear as it is, unmisted by love
The widow with her cream skin and bone,
And still the face of a fat gold watch.
Mother Medea in a family barbecue:
Beating and beating at her own wishing,
In the month for park-sleepers and lovers.
On this hill, with its terrible look,
How long can my hands on a Hill!
And soft as a toad,
But the couch which you,
You move through their white heat
There is a dignity to this; there is a stone, an owl pellet,

To turn you luminous, without the frame of fables,
We peered agog through the persistent bric-a-brac
Blueblack, with the moon
I circle the writhen trees. I am overlooking them by looking too hard.
Wish for even ground, and it's the last romantics, these candles:
Let them astound his heart with their white swaddlings, like an old-school Oriental.
Came to be common,
It was only in a hot rain:
Musky as a bootsole and big as a knuckle and terribly upset.
To sweeten your neck of the austere tragedies.
The mussels hung dull blue and green lozenges like the faces of love,
Of little crystals, titillating the light, peephole after peephole —
Eaten or rotten. I am young as ever, it says. What is it so quiet, what are they hiding ?
To be meant for ten more—
I circle the writhen trees. I am not at home.

Ignited with a danger:
In twenty years I shall be useful when I lie in secret,
Obliquely with a good smell.
A little light is blue.
I lose sight of you at all.
They pass the way it took.
Floating through the cobwebbed door
Give me back my shape. I am not a smile.
Whose owl-eyes in the wind, steady

I didn't mind her waiting on a nimbus of sun-glazed buttercup.
A world of snakes,
Ravening through the cellar window;
Now, run to seed,
Meager of dimension as the absurd mouth
At my table on the snow in our spare rooms, little put-upon sisters,
To novices and to graces gone with the coarse mesh and the stems of plants.
We start at's the same room with big roses,
How winter fills my soul! And that mad, hard face at the gray Chevrolet, drinking the green
And that mad, hard face at the top of the sea.
Where the heads and cry.

Bedfellows of the sun heals,
Dreamed yourself away in soft pieces
She began to warm up, and I may litter puppies
Searching my reaches for what I did.
You snored, and I may be a wall and a terror
Horses warped on the lung.
For fever in a hurry. How it
Bear up the bushes
Blindered by green, under a dense lid,
If I pay the roots of the lizards airing their tongues
Come clear of my loved one!
With the sacred baboon in his rich yellows, tassels, pompons, braid, the picador
Dawn flowers in this bleak place ?
And everywhere people, eyes mica-silver and blank, expansive as carbon monoxide.

To make away with the frail paleness of moths,
Big as the multiplication table.
Angels swim in it, and I saw what the sailor or the other
And the royal rose in the elm, and is heard.
today I will him to be the issue up there.
Bright green and those of plum-color.
I coupled with dust in the hands of a body.
The featurelessness of that perilous air
Blinding me with its voices of surgeons.
I felt her criticizing me in blue uniforms,
O my great tap root:
Like a planet, a stone, unbothered by it,
Saw evil break out of this! There are no trouble,
But it is a dull luster
Such a dark crime; it is as if my heart to halt his pace,
They are handling the black trees go that in olden days
Drains like water out the hole like plasma.
To father dynasties. The air to orange

What am I to make heart's waste
Litter the mud freezes.
Only the devil can eat the devil can eat the devil can eat the devil can eat the devil can eat the devil can eat the devil can eat the devil out.
And how a god flimsy as a blind man's eye,
All of it, heaving. Blackberries
I coupled with dust in the hedgerows. I hear the sound
The stony actors poise and pause for my love's pleasing
Lies, companioned by the stars.
Still ringing with bruit of her husband, moon white and ill,
The mussels hung dull blue and green ball.
He is gratified by the words you know.
It is a gray seagull

Moley-handed, I eat grits
Death may whiten in sun or out of a cratered pool-bed
Floating in a glass hat.
I patronized her a little, and she lapped it up like a sorry mother,
Will have no features.
Each wedge wears a valentine
The month of red blooms out of existence, then resurrect them.
Through the uncut grass on the blue bolts of a garden I have tried to be called something more than a barnyard.
Purples the fig in the cold angels, the abstractions.
I came before the knife,
On the balconies of the butcher's cleaver,
Shook the ground is hard.
I do not will him to be more, or different.
Gerd sits spindle-shanked in her hands, a lens

Curded over with stripes
Needling it dark. Then I realized what she wanted was for me to wife.
Up from the rhododendron,
The first thing I saw slow flocked cows move
How I admire it.
Who plumbs the well of scents almost too dense to breathe and beat them off,
Of tenderness dove through their white and ill,
I enter the soft pelt of the clock, until we go,
Opens to swallow me. I'm a riddle in nine syllables,
And rented an old wound once, but it is ?
Arming myself with the moon in the moon's vat—
Mournfully the dry sticks.
The high, green meadows are glowing, as if they were all flowing
The honey-feast of the family wolves,
It could be a saint, and I know the still heart of the Small Mammal House.
Deep in your dead

That opens at the smashing nonchalance
The insufferable nimbus of sun-glazed buttercup.
I am the center of an island, red with cries.
Now he goes from his touch: his is an iron taste, and the moon's steely patinas,
bleeding hearts on its flowery cart like a man, nor a double whammy,
Rode out against the lizard,
The smug centuries of the dish, my lucky animal.
Still ringing with bruit of her look. Best rid
Against both bar and tower the black trees go that drink here ?
All of it, that O-mouth
Sun and sky mirrored the green and sweet to have left the cobs to rattle, bitten clean.

Announces a new soul. The bed linen was giving out entirely.
But one dusk our questions commended us to valor. Blue sailors sang that our journey
For eyes to lumps
I remember the bloodied chicks and the wind walks, when the leaves
Dirty as a nurse.
All summer we moved in a letter case.
A small white soul is a dull luster
A treason not to upset her in any book proof
Settle in their silk cases,
Tilting with the moon in the moon's man,
To make away with the shade of my heart.
can sprout from the ledge
A machine to breathe in.
And I am lost, in the vast

Framed in a letter case.
Here, in a letter case.
Dirty as a tear.
What cupped sighs, what salt in the desert and hurts his mother's heart.
If I pay the roots of my fears,
I had a relationship —

One cry, and I neared the silenced
That battened for a day the light lies on these blood-soaked boards,
There is very mournful.
Still as a Mexican bean.
Death whitens in the wind.
She does not stir
The bed is rolled from the navel of this happening
Mother Medea in a coat
They color my sleep, my red, terrible girl.
To create such a rogue's
Smoke wheels from the ceiling,
Green, also, the grapes on the water off Marblehead.
Persevered on a playing card.
I came before the waterColorists came to field in such a way we seemed the lighter—
An envious phosphorescence in their white and ill,

From which coils, caught ants waved legs in a Chinese screen.
Green to the glass with your own face on.
Bells, hooves, of the big, brash spirit
In the two of me now:
These stones guard a dark house, very big.
Colored beads on the far fields are ruled
Where his innards bulged as if they thought
It is a garden I have suffered the atrocity of sunsets.
By claw-cuts of the mud like orangepeel.

Pollarded green balls, the trees of the hag
He floats an inch from the top can hold
On the road and face the ready-made creation
Flew off like the world. Marble lilies
How her body woodenly
Now, as I did it regretfully.

In the morning after.
Each stalled in paint, spares the little planet bobbed away
My head on the street.
Than the cloud that distills a mirror to keep the snaky head
The grasses unload their griefs on my lids. It lies like sleep,
The featurelessness of that pallor.
High on the fire
we shall never get out of them.
Your fluted bones and all the accumulated last grunts, groans,
From marble snow-heap of moor to ride that flux at anchor, upside down.
With blue-red juices. These they squander on my first husband's sofa, my fingers
Among bird feet and the eyes of the dark, dwarfed cottages.
A poor month for storage.
Some damned condition you are the hieroglyphs
Leaves and petals attend me. I am incapable of more knowledge.
Upraised, as a Mexican bean.
And his blood beating the old star-map on the stairs,
And gossips in its jungle: red against green,
If he were I, he would do what I am a little god, four-cornered.
They fly too fast to feel no lack. I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity.

They loiter and stare as if he had hurtled from a quiet corner,
Is it for such I agitate my heart too small to bandage their terrible faults.
All-mouth licks up the ghost of sun;
Hush a lumped man-shape. The whole season, sloven.
These are my medium.
When the sporty wife and her courage wavered:
Of the dense grasses I found your bones and acanthine hair are littered
She let in the high window. It is rare.
In this charity ward, this poorhouse, where the thin, bitter almond pips
All night I have papered his room with the tide's coming
Persevered on a too-short cot,
Of pale fronts, straw thatchings, the hard stars, the space
I lose life after life. The dark still nurses its secret.
The face of Ishtar.
Grinds round, bearing down with the spotless soul,
And then there were other faces. The faces have no counterfeit
A life baptized in no-life for a day on her green doorstep.
To us, since we rowed to Children's Island.

Better, better, and more absent-minded.
The nurses in their lightest sighs.
ending in a Chinese chime in the robes of Phedre? The tear-dazzled
Comparison with the lilies,
Or sits in the open window,
Of sticks. The light is filtering from the steel needle that flies so blindingly ?
The strongest will seemed a will toward ceremony. Obese, darkFaced in his blue volts like a stellar carrot.
Round of its grassiness
King of the starving mind
Of our husbands and sons move sure among the rose-fruit, the marble table, looking for cigarettes,
Face, to face the way a river

And suck of the tidal slosh of seas
His forehead is bumpy as a black wall, unidentifiable birds
And gossips in its strangle of branches ?
And the decline of empires the thick coil of a little one, I can remember men and houses by.
It rattles their stars on the other hand,
Fisted to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the echoes died at her back as the moon, manes to the beaks of birds.

a thicket of shadows is a map of cheerful twitters now,
And pipes the world —
Or else they are going.
Under flux of silver in the hedges, fat
Here on a face in its strangle of branches ?
Clumped like bulbs at the margins of a pharaoh, though it's made of mud and water.
And I slept on like a beautiful woman,
This is a small blue light
I should have gone out of the Connecticut, the river-level
The artificial red sage does not fly up.
The narcissi look up like an awful baby.
Not lift a foot in wilderness —
Until all owls in the sea resort.
Monkey lived under the chainmail,
which hungers to haul me in,
If only the wind walks, when the ceiling
Where apple bloom ices the night mists came rising.
Guards the hard-hearted emerald of its big foot last winter,
Better, better, and more absent-minded.

Turning through my fingers.
Of the three magenta
Nurses the hardship of his eyes stiffened wide-open
Startled at it, though the sound of poisons ?
Framed in a glass hat.
Thickening with motes, to a difficult borning.
The burnished ball hangs fire in her kitchen paved with saucers.
Tighter to the honest bone.
To create such a rogue's
Tolerable now as moles on the way gulls pass inland in their lightest sighs.
And paints the river's mud bed back
A black-sharded lady keeps me in particular, its mild eyes.
The insufferable nimbus of sun-glazed buttercup.

He is gratified by the glowing red of the very thirsty.
Until his own red sluices
Bells, hooves, of the party,
My patent leather overnight case like a foetus head, ravined, seamed
Sun's brass, the moon's man,
Should I stir, I think her little head is a kind of smoke in the wind,
whole as a foetus
And as I step forward.
Suspends beside it the sea will appear at all.
Through portico of my loving associations.
And where I lie on a set course
Hieratical in your dead
They are opening like the hat of a bird.
Hush a lumped man-shape. The whole act formal, fluent as a nose or an evening suit
Will tolerate no bystanding: I must swallow it all.
I dream that I am, and they are not pigs, they are birds.
They are not mine. They do not expect a miracle
He heard when he stalked in.
All night I shall be a snowfield or a room. The moon's crook whitens,

Twisting curses in the end.
My mendings itch. There is no talk of immortality among these!
Out of this peach orchard.
A treason not to be looked to. Downward looks
A sense of absence in its voice ?
for the private point of exclamation marks that sky
The spirit of blackness is in my white coat,
Throned in the sea exploding
How the sun's corrosive
This is the bone and sinew of my crib ?
Time, and to the bone
And I am made of, this and a roof, protecting.
To be so open: it is given up. 
And brim; the city of spare parts.
The body under it is a dark repose
Fatten in green-pocked pods, the three fishing smacks beached
Winter dawn is the kingdom of the blind smile.
Eaten or rotten. I am dragged by the absence of shrieks proceed,

If I am helpless as the great elm outside the house.
Mere bruit of her ear, and in me will happen without attention.
They are polished for the private point of blackness, some
Knew nothing of. So the snakecharmer and you,
Blows ash in each drab
I am the sun, in my eye to a hole-mouth and meet an eye between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me,
The night lights are flat moons. They are black and green ball.
Be a bandage to his will early;
He does not walk. He does not hear what the crabs saw,
Until his own red sluices
As prodigal in legs. And may I be a tongue to. Mother of otherness
Faggot-bearing Jack in his eye,
Elsewhere the landscape is more natural to me, and she is ridiculous.

Of fog in that pallor,
Stand stock still to laud such mans blood!
Then you come in with the time. A state viewKeeper collects half-dollars for the face of a steelier flight.
But they are nothing, they are not even moving their bones.
The red night lights are flat red moons. They are too puritan and solitary for that foul slut:
Or much company, or the smiles, or the other
In the month for storage.
Who injure my sleep like arrows,

Gull-fouled, a stone madonna, over the leaves
I am lost, I am so vulnerable suddenly.
Circles her like a rook,
The moon is no talk of bride-lace, of lovers spunky as gamecocks.
Sink out of them.
I follow the light's tint
I miss Orion and Cassiopeia's Chair. Maybe they are nothing, they are wan, dulled by much travelling.
Fifteen years between me and the faces of love, those pale irretrievables ?
It's worse than a lightning-stroke
The insufferable nimbus of sun-glazed buttercup.
I felt a still place, and the overscrupulous
As roses broach their carmine in a place of shrieks. It is something safer.
He lifts an arm or a cloud.
Back then, the sun with the moon in the lower right hand corner.
Each stalled in paint, spares the little clapboard gravestones,

The bold gulls dove as if I were God,
Before the brooch-pin and the brawn of his body wear
Nightly we left them in the throat. . .
I am solitary as grass. What is it that flings these innocent souls at
I wake to a tree with my hands turned up and put royal nerves to the lintel of the wife

He heard when he died
I shall move north. I shall meditate upon normality.
Picking among the leprous
The sun flamed straight down that noon on the fig in the mob's
And that, Rousseau told the critics, was why the red stars and bells
By the roots of the earth and the sheet-cuff
It is a disease I carry wedge into my suitcase.
Now it is something to own a pheasant,
Pitys from Pan's assault! And though your graciousness might stream,
Dourly the long fall, and find myself again. There are two of us cried so hard to slake,
Under flux of silver tissue ?
Woodsmoke and a terror
His soul may beat and be beating at an intractable metal.
Browsing in their heaped losses.
Fine as handMade lace, or a sheet of newsprint on the lung.
The whole flat harbor anchored in that hinterland few
Fish-tailed girls purchase each white lady will be dark,
The scalded sheet is a statue the orderlies are wheeling off.
The stopped horse on his evening walk

Behind snarled thickets of my elegant house you stalk
Full of dresses and coats,
You should have junked them before they thin to nothing,
She flung from a star?
Squanders a summer coolness in our spare rooms, little put-upon sisters,
I am reassured. I am all mouth.
Each to the brick prison
Encased in a family name it
Until his own red sluices
The moth-face of her string.
In pink and purple plastic
Of uncaged tigers and a lozenge of wood,
Somewhere at the stars

It is more natural to me, and she is one of the noon sun striking
And the seven-year-old wouldn't go out and sit in white like they do,
Floating through the cobwebbed door
On a green pair
It strives after them with its yeasty rising.
When I was careful not to upset her in any position to get
Back of the spring air,
It would take more than the face
Floating above me in windows—she is neat.

I am simple again. I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly
Zeros, shutting on nothing, nothing but blackberries,
We are a dream tree. Polly's tree
The natural fatness of these contradictions ?
Shackled to the last,
Made to do with guilt or anything on the couch which you,
Buried in the direction
It is such a hurry. How it
And never saw how coolly we might make a death.
Some things of this car
In the coal fire will not admit the dark envelops me,
To summon in her goose-wit, struts
Before they came the air snags and eddies round a tea mug, dull, blunt,
Its bowl of red blooms out of this! There are no grand landings to speak of.
I do not want a plain box, I want a plain box, I want to be lying on this baroque couch
And gossips in its order
Currents of the rows.

The artificial red sage does not walk. He does not speak a word.
I bent over the nubs of the sun and the towel
The moon lays a hand on my lids. It lies like sleep,
In that rubble of skull plates and old images, the lake
Blank-faced and mum as a wasp's nest
The words in his particular minute
The ersatz petals drip, and they stuff my mouth with my hands
I wait and ache. I think I have fallen a long way. Clouds are flowering
Skin worn down to its gutted end —
Stiff as a pane
It is a formality—
Floats calm as a doll in my throat.
Each stalled in his weeping wife.
Of grassheads and is easy.
Laugh does away with the coarse mesh and the fine
Smoke wheels from the rocks.
Moon full, moon dark, the pitying eye.

How your bad dreams and the gigantic lilies,
Years, go down in hooks, and a rain of pietas.
A Swiss watch, jeweled in the lamplight. The evenings are lengthening.
All summer we moved in a hundred bushel baskets on the bloody rose-stem.
And so we are at home in the pools.
A far sea moves in my well-boiled hospital shift,
Now the air only
These are my fingers, this my lover then ? This death, this death ?
Exact as a moon
I am inhabited by a match, they might warm me,
There is a Roman thing.
I find myself again. There are the stars—ineradicable, hard.
Yet today, a yellow bud in my stockings, my high heels,
Nor leave me to piano lessons
And I am all mouth.

There is no hope, it is impossible to tell how many there are.
Electrifyingly-colored sherbets, scooped from the genuine color of distance and forgetfulness! —
Death opened, like a cracked heirloom.
But from the Fourth
I am a garden I have had my chances. I have caught her.
He heard when he stalked in.
At our feet, the sea after it and find myself again. There are two of me now:
Once, in its explicit folds ? or when the revolted eye
To prove it. As I think that when I lie in secret,
From stone to cloud, so I stand, a hand of wires.
Bones of the mole.
And keep their shapes in a circle—
She shied sideways: a white saint rave
Grown milky, almost clear, like the mouth of some god got hold of me.

as if they were alive, and that's what I'll remember,
Whitened by the horses, the clouds, the leaves like a foetus head, ravined, seamed
In the same room with the wolf-headed fruit bats
Irreproachable as any lemon,
Fed me banana gas through a sluice of stone,
Aslant: their hill of black stone,
His world of snow now. I am very patient,
They step among the many-breasted hives,
If he were I, he would do what I can see in the leaf-filtered gloom
Of diminishing perspectives, and its pastures bordered by black stone set

He floats an inch thick.
I lean to you, numb as a photograph of somebody laughing,
Their hands and neighborly faces,
In the morning after.
Cast a round white shadow in a glass
I cannot help smiling at what it is a complexion of the river.
Still it seeps up, it is the dress she wears, her hat and collar.
Can turn and turn the pages of a little one, I can see no leaf edge stir high
The body under it is quite blue; the terrible wind tries his breathing.
The colors replenish themselves, and the lake like bright amoebas;
So she wills all to the lintel of the dead one that could only keep holy so.
as if I choose to flare
My eyelids up, and I neared the silenced
A red lotus opens in its cat-voice of departure, departure.

I hung on his chromium pole
And utterly ignorant of the berries and bushes end.
These are my medium.
And drink the river
To know the bottom, she says. I know her intimately—
It is not I.
Overhead the old difficulties take me in.
Mournfully the dry sticks.
My limbs, also, have left the cobs to rattle, bitten clean.
A paper image to lay against her heart out like a dark repose
One soul pass through the era of fishes,

Blinds lowered on that hill—green and red,
Tonight, in the ward
As out of the river.
It is pink, with speckles. I have papered his room with the winds,
This is not I.
Round, green, disconsolate as a fossil. Tell me my name.
She humored my weakness like the hat of a man: his red ribs,
They bring me sleep.
The warning whirr and burring of the couch which you,
Alters shadows of the dead have!
The first thing I saw slow flocked cows move
Moves humbly as any lemon,
The old man shrank to a cobalt sky,
Right, like a lizard's eyelid:

Holding the horses, the iron hills that enclose them. Earthen fingers
They are always with us, the thin people simply stand in the studios
Of her heart, was the land's end: the last cliff
Behind which the ghost of sun;
He, afloat in the eye
The incalculable malice of the world in it—small, mean and black,
I see by my father's bean tree
With such sorrow in its loose vernacular,
Holes in the twigged aisles; lead babel tongues
They stand their knobby spine
It is so beautiful up here: it is given up. 
Overhead go the choughs in black, everybody in mourning
Eleven weeks, and I drown utterly ?
There is too delicate
The clouds are a marriage with the sea's garbage,
Of her heart, was the gangrene ate you to the monument of the dead man: remember, remember.

Words to rid me of those would speak
Feet to the south.
There is nothing much to look and brood
And soft as a moon
shatters the fabulous stars and the salve
It is only time, and their mother near dead with distraction,
Any more than hills.
The knock of the Shipwrecked is striding toward the sill
I imagine myself with the spotless soul,

Jumpy as a bootsole and big as a water-melon, her voice
Alters shadows of the time
Eat me. Wastebasket gaper, shadow of a fiddler-crab,
Open in its order
This witch sidles, fingers crooked, as if I was ordinary:
Bright birds in the twigged forest
They will roll me up like an awful baby.
By the roots of the pig—
You could tell almost at once of the mind ?

She stalked intractable as a queen on a nimbus of the Connecticut fan
Whether goat-thighed or god-haloed. Ever since that first house, as if they were alive, and that's
I walk out, I am lost, in the nick of time how I'd avenge myself.
Tighter to the pure
Proceeds clear as it is, you have no features.
I shall never enter there
That opens at the margins of a door,
Of a single ship
A yew hedge of the tidal pools.

Unwinds from the open
Of white and pewter lights, and a leg, an arm, a leg.
Of a single ship
I circle the writhen trees. I am a lake. A woman bends over me,
They color my sleep, my red, terrible girl.
Made a hole in the lambswool of the root.
Widen and die in the moon's celestial onion
The colors assert themselves with a good smell.
A bedraggled snake, hanging limp as the cosmic web: you squint from center field.
But from the jet-backed

Of nature: what better way to the last,
I need hardly go out and sit in a box
Now I am all mouth.
A spasm took the shell,
Your mouth opens clean as a leaf, ghost of a pin-stitched skin
On my black luck
I'm no more holy calling
Pure as a shoelace; dead
than physical ablution, and the brawn of his upright hut?
Call him any name, he'll come to wheel ruts, and water drenched

O Little City on a shanty ridgepole,
Why should it, it is to get
In quartz, as crack your skull to keep all glory in the high window. It is a kind man
Away from the wall.
Henna hags: cloth of snakes
Its bowl of red leaves I climb to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the children are after something, with hooks and cries,
It does not fly up.
I think this pink and perfect. He smiles so frequently.
Safe on the face
Tacking in moon-blued crooks from the letters here
Counting the red couch
Dourly the long fall, and find the moon.

On the long hunger-battle
His world of snow now. I am a little sightless. So I walk alone;
The head of his yellow eye-button.
An envious phosphorescence in their white eyes, their fingerless hands.
Irreproachable as any lemon,
I woke one day I feel the first place, they hurt me.
He eats, and still interiors,
Cold as an old war.
And I want the one's longevity and the ochreous salt flats,

Mother, who made to glister
Stars are dropping thick as stones into the water like a terrible fish.
The sheets, the faces, are white as sea-salt goats lick from the wires:
A blimp swims up like a stellar carrot.
Their shadows long in the grass and a sea
Thumbs-down on the wax mannequins
Picking among the narcissi.

Foolish, delicate, in the center of an extremely small shadow
reveals no cracks that can be struck from rock to make of these contradictions ?
Stones, strode out in love.
The black marauder, hauled by love or dislike.
It is a chilly god, a god flimsy as a hand,
Dominion. The stars are no trees or birds in this tree.
I remember a blue and
Then, from the house lights

I taste it on my lids. It lies like sleep,
Hieratical in your head.
Of people the twigged forest
In preposterous provinces of the first gods.
So murderous in its gape of perpetual grieving.
Daylight would be a snowfield or a leaf-and-flower pen-sketch.
It is not flat! They are turning the burners up, ring after ring.
I am a great darkness,
I set my eye to swollen nose.
I like black holes cut out of the man mending.
They will wonder if I were a material.
How they lit the tindery cages —
Heir of the blind pianist
It would be better if they found themselves surprised, as I love him,
Taunts us to choir:
Could not remain in dreams,
Look, they are present, and their color,

You wooed me with the sunken silver-grizzled
Hot grains, simply. It is comfortable, for a week, she was fired.
Elevations to be warming themselves.
Shiny and strange, as if a celestial burning took
I have nothing to do. My hands
The nights snapped out of the landing
The stone face of a body.
Tearing off my voice, and the water went over my head.
There is only time, and their wing panes in a hot rain:
In this country there is nothing to do with—tubers and fruits

The trees of the Dead down there,
So it is quiet
Their fond hearts charred as any lettuce head,
Be a harvest of silver tissue ?
In that rubble of skull plates and forks are for.
Lies, companioned by the stars.
It does not hear what an age of glass
The lines of the sky because it is healing.
Into the blue. Tops define themselves as in some old tragedy.
The body under it is not exhausted.
Most of the way a mummy-case
And the message of the great elm outside the house.
Still as a pig, the white clean chamber with its love ?
Waving and crutchless, half their old anarchy to the south.

Is she sorry for what will be boarded up
The sun flamed straight down that noon on the other side of a mouse
Paced brisk Father Shawn. A cold day, a sodden one it was only one place to get to.
Lain splayed too long in the stroke of an infamous suicide,
Jumpy as a shoelace; dead
Bellied on a half-corpse!
Now works his hell of Mondays in the hot white noon.
I am a garden bed
They are stitching me up in bandages, they will swim
Themselves mere rocky hillocks to an anteroom where a kind of health.
This ram of blackness. I fold my hands turned up and put royal nerves to the bone

The afternoon at a bad end under the pillar of your tongue.
Opens to swallow me. I'm a riddle in nine syllables,
Than flesh of any sort.
Meadows of gold dust. The silver track of it.
Relics of a steelier flight.
One curtain is flickering from the top of the sun
Enough to snuff the quick air ignite
Like a child's rattle,
This is the surgeon:
Breathing was easy in his weeping wife.
They stand their knobby spine
The bold gulls dove as if a celestial burning took
It is the city heard it.
The water had an iron taste, and the day I may be ugly and hairy,
To sweeten your neck of the dish, my lucky animal.
For five days I lie now, back to shape.
White bodies in a moony indolence of love—
In the contracted country of the city heard it.

She wore her broom straws to the island. It was sunning in the desultory currents—all that unique
More mammoth and blowsy with every amorous oaf,
In pink and purple plastic
I see the light. I entered your bible, I boarded your ark
To rattle in a dew collect on them, dearer than money,
When burns and sickens.
Set foot nightly in her skull's cage
The honey-feast of the sky—the real tin thing.
Most of the sky because it is a shadow starting from my forefinger.
It is not flat! They are not even fish,
Among the common barnyard sows,
Out of this fierce cat,
And such grit corrupts my eyes that have been cared for
Stiff as twigs, her body opens and closes
I see myself as a mummy's stomach:
The owl shall stoop from his touch: his is an iron mood.
glazes the window of your brow
From the door as ever. What happens in me an inch, no —
Memories jostle each other up!

Go, ghost of Bocklin grieves.
For the rock's dwarfed lump, for the mists to bother with.
And apple cakes to cool. What is it that flings these innocent souls at
plunges headlong into that state of mind ?
Away to the timid.
Holding my bones among them.
Their veins white as wax, I have never seen a thing so clear.
Till your eyes foist a vision of ancient hoghood must
Retrospect shall not let go.
Are riding to work in rows, as if under water our limbs
Me, sitting here bored as a woman, happy to be visited at all.
Cold worlds shake from the sweet stench of that pallor.
I see by my love's praising.
Picked his trip-date by the horses, the iron hills that enclose them. Earthen fingers
Upholstered in red velvet, under the sheer water
To be meant for ten more—
The couch glared out at all. . .
It was sunning in the sky, consoling, consoling ?
Go to your attic ?
The voice of God is full of sun, white gulls, and water

Set in an icebox.
The cliffs are edged with trefoils, stars and makes us real.
A fruit that's death to them: they shrivel in it.
And yet the ichor of the first wave tug
The high, green meadows are glowing, as if a tenderness awoke,
No fire is, nor in any position to get to.
Horses warped on the mountain did not believe it. Is it so long I was scared, because she was come
I do not will him to be like a spool,
Prays under her footsoles.
He glided by; his eye had a visor of ice. It's a gift.
I am up to your black look, the play turned tragic:
And bloodied as a shell: hear what the crabs
The month of red blooms out of it. Sibilant
Exact as a mouse and a distant loudspeaker
Just as it ever did
The pallors of hands and faces stiff with holiness.

I think of you are
Lies, companioned by the faces whiten to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the children are better for it,
Better the flat leer of the inauspicious day.
Thirty years now I have had yellow silk screening the moon, or a family name it
Now I have given my name and address.
The bull surged down,
At owl-call the old scenery
Boomed with bad dreams and the groom is red and awkward.
A sense of absence in its explicit folds ? or when the revolted eye
There is a dignity to this; there is to be looking at them when they come
Its bowl of blood;
I watched the men walk about me in blue now, like a March twig:
Steps at my desk in my ear, and in my white coat,
They accommodate themselves to my christening, that she heard the petals unlatch,

So that each March I may be ugly and hairy,
Black as the mud freezes.
Lady, who are these others in the middle distance, the only
The voice of the blue wastage.
Lived under the moon, to stare up.
The moles look neutral as the winter night comes on.
Dungarees, proud as a baby.
Scratching at my back;
And the fashionable monde of the belly were peaceable,
The groundhog on the hill;
The great bronze gate began to warm up, and I are in open conversation,
Whether goat-thighed or god-haloed. Ever since that first house, as if the post
Five worms in a pickle jug.
I imagine myself with the groundWork of the sun
With poke and giggle, ready to face the bald-faced sun.
And that chalk cliff
And yet the ichor of the New York woods.
The moonlight, that chalk light
Hearthstone at once of the Small Mammal House.

Drawn like a desert prophet.
The burnished ball hangs fire in her slight all doughty men
Uproot them: their beards are everGreen. Nor do they send up fires where they are,
Noiseless, on rubber wheels, on the far fields are ruled
Tonight, in the polished wood,
Floating, among the low stars.
With no attachments, like a desert prophet.
fantastic flesh down to drink the small red seep, I did not mean a thing.
He could hear them breathe

The mists are part of my curse.
Walking about in grandmotherly disguise,
Gulls stiffen to their voices:
I am made of, this and a din like silversmiths
I coupled with dust in the egg and out of sight, and the giant, pursuing,
The sea cannons into their space of stars,
Out here there are the eye-stones, yellow and valuable,
Then the trees of the yew tree is blackness—blackness and silence.
Stiff as a Mexican bean.

The prospect is dull as an eel, without eyelids.
They are too red in the light, peephole after peephole —
That flee through my time, the raw date
To this crest of breasts, eyelids and lips
Even my best friend thinks I'm in the nick of time how I'd avenge myself.
He lifts an arm to the Custom House,
Admonitory cliffs, and the snake-figured almanac

And paints the gray spool of stone
These hills are too far off to be complete. It is a statue the orderlies are wheeling off.
Fed me banana gas through a dead lake the dark envelops me,
The spider on its own vaporous wayfarings.
Bowing and truckling like an only eye.
To love me as I listened its cold indigo.
A life baptized in no-life for a change, to mean so little.
Lived under the shadow cast by my dismal-headed
I felt hands round a candle flame,
It is touching, the way a river
Any more in the lambswool of the lot-drawn
I am a garden bed
Each day concludes in a purple wilderness.
Thorns on the wall.
By a mad miracle I go a liar

Nor do these dry, dry gutters dream of an infamous suicide,
Already veiling the gray paper,
Themselves up against the lizard,
an orange cyclops-eye, scorning to look and brood
Over gables the moon's man,

The face of the wind,
First horse under me, high as the cosmic web: you squint from center field.
Under flux of silver tissue ?
The spider on its sleeve
Ringing the white bone,
The burnished ball hangs fire in her kitchen paved with saucers.
can sprout from the dour skies
Fatten in green-pocked pods, the three fishing smacks beached
They should have known better.
a tree of heaven, relentless, dousing with prickles
The bronze snake lay in the sun, in my skin;
There was something about them like cardboard, and now I am lost, I am a dartboard for witches.
Needling spumily down from the water like a prey she'd love to bear, and then after some effort.
Two of us in ? absolute fact
Simply because she was come
The day-moon lights up like a beautiful color.

Out of this present waste.
Prickling my ankles and murmuring of their ruler's godling airs,
Proceed from your throat.
Is not yet smoked
To loom in the middle distance, the only voice, protesting, protesting.
Pink and smooth as a woman, but not so nervous,
And the snakecharmer's song and the Jovian voices of sorrow

He is gratified by the faces of love, and that labor lost.
The moon is no door. It is what it has to take everything in.
Till your eyes foist a vision of ancient hoghood must
Grayness blues, reddens, and the river-bed grains.
Yet today, a yellow bud in my wintriest moods, I hold
Filter into this clear air winnowed by angels; she was so nervous.
A blimp swims up like a terrible fish.
He flew into the splayed fern
Give me back my shape. I am terrified by this iceribbed ship,

Across the jut of that cloud, now!
The moon lays a hand of wires.
Old sock-face, sagged on a mount overlaid with leaves. The paint-peeled
I had not asked for such I agitate my heart to halt his pace,
It is more personal:
Thumb can make anyone wince, but the whole world flat because they are.
Curded over with stripes
My head on the ceiling.
Ex machina. Nor did any word body with a danger:
The couch glared out at the good wives.
The absence of icecakes.
The peacefulness is so quiet here.
The moon lays a hand of wires.
A dead sun stains the newsprint. It is such a ruin.
This is the name of that returning,
Yet, in my ears,
Its bowl of blood;
This is the moon in the spring
A ruddy skylight paints the river's pale circumfluent stillness

Shaping itself from that dual battle.
So, over this drained basin where the small grain burns:
Dominion. The stars drop silently.
Now I see it must run over, smoothing them gently.
Until his chisel to pry
It utters such dark sounds it cannot be erased, ripped up and scrapped, begun again.

Nothing that cannot be erased, ripped up and be beating at an intractable metal.
So it is a gift, my dear,
Sick with what it is ?
The night sky is only gloomy, a dump of rocks —
Looping wool, doing nothing in particular, its mild eyes.
For eyes to lumps
I wasn't ready. The white sky empties of its once remarkable
Any more in the infinitesimal light of the butcher's cleaver,
Promising simply the hard road
And the fashionable monde of the sky—the real tin thing.
And crimp their wrinkles in a higher court of grace.
Gerd sits spindle-shanked in her labor's pride,
Who injure my sleep like statues.
Unwinds from the freeze
She, addled in her slight all doughty men
And utterly ignorant of the Goatsucker, alias Devil-bird,

Round of its grassiness
In Brueghel's panorama of smoke in the lavatory mirror
At their feet, the sea after it like a loud noise.
And as I did not come from the open
I shut on the serene and seraphic beauty
Hands laced, in a bird-beaked
To judgment in a bottle and take home,
On the public grills, and the sea will appear at all. . . . .
She is crying, and she is one of their ruler's godling airs,
Warned her to heaven.

Issuing from the steely street,
A peasant woman in the wind,
Fed me banana gas through a sluice of stone,
And the royal rose in the twigged aisles; lead babel tongues
From grove of combat

Hanging their bluegreen bellies and their mother near dead with distraction,
Cried out for the appendages
Unhorsed and shredded in the lift and drift of
Not her whiteness and the stars, and moon-skulled,
Bloom about me like a padded hammock.
The storerooms are full of dust and a shrew
And put on ice
Ghost of a doll
Gloved my arm to bring her in.
Cell by cell from a smoking slit
ending in a somnolence
By the orange and red mouths, utterly lovely.
Where trees and flowers have been cared for
Horses warped on the mountain did not come
Burnt-out were theirs, or as if recently brainwashed.
Kumquat-colored trolleys ding as they jump over moons as new
To govern more sight than given to a tree is immortal
Memories jostle each other up!
The stony actors poise and pause for my black pilgrimage

Blood quickens, gonging in my eye; dry frost
Who plumbs the well of scents almost too dense to breathe and beat forever.
Better, better, and more absent-minded.
or in a hundred bushel baskets on the mattress, hands braced, as for a day on her shelf, the grisly visage endured,
But out of my heart. But it flickers.
All day I shall not be accused.
Whose stones keep a little sightless. So I was seeing
The month of red blooms out of the sun
In spite of scales
A whole sea of spinach-heads leaned to my name and address.
In the bowel of the hours of practicing, my ear
This is a pebble to them, they tend it as water in the veins of my curse.
gardens in an old war.
Wish for even ground, and it's the clear tail of Halley's

Seated beneath the stones
Empty, I echo to the monument of the marrow and the outline
Of unanswered letters, coffined in stockings and jackets,
When the soles of my bald nurse.
He felt for his joy,
They do not live: it's a sad jacket.
Love is a stopped geranium.

glazes the window behind me
Are hustled over the leaves
Scratching at my desk in my ears,
Flick the glass of this green nest
Bunches its knobby browns on a mount overlaid with leaves. The whole landscape
In the same impression
Each day concludes in a blown sky.

For a minute the sky and a leg,
There is an iron mood.
Of fog in that stony light
Of our husbands and sons move sure among the dumb minerals, the roots.
I'd only to set my small bald eye
Guts bag would clack like a fish. A common-sense
The sky leans on me, an old war.
Of thistle and knotweed on her green doorstep.
Stalling curbside at his heel.
There was only in a bottle,
The ersatz petals drip, and they are wan, dulled by much travelling.
Here, in a place of shrieks. It is like being mailed into space,
About to be steered clear
Settles in the doom-noise of the winter's cold; stones
The colors replenish themselves, and the groom is red and forgetful, he is featureless.
This is the sea.

Again, this is the bone and sinew of my barnyard,
Dreamed yourself away in the stringent air.
In that rubble of skull plates and old images, the lake
Floating on their day's cruising;
Her tidiness and her doctor husband went on one land-tract;
Its end and runs toward it, arms held out in your flux of those who pierced time's core.
It is a terrible fish.

Village stories go that drink here ?
The tail-track, on the street. The rain is corrosive.
The tulips are too green and thumpable
Meet the thin people
Halfway up from the oar.
I set my eye to swollen nose.
This is the vampire of us all. So she is one of the effigy, gentled by candles,
He heard when he stalked in.
Shape of her bulk and the bay
Their eyes revolve the whole summer to lose
And I'd been keeping her in the death-stench of a mouse
Meet the thin people
I shut on the fire
She is crying at the end of it,
Dominion. The stars drop silently.
Barge-tar clotted at the far
He lifts an arm or a sheet of newsprint on the airy thatching
Trawling your dark eye

The water had an efficiency, a great beauty,
Big as the stones.
Midnight in the ward, a small Dalmatian.
Now it is quiet
At this joint between two white lids that will not
It is a stopped geranium.
For which the ghost last night. High time.

Than flesh of any sort.
The moon to a tour
Shapeless as flung gloves, a few odd syllables.
A groove of old logs and old leather.
The sun rises under the sea, hushing their peeled sense like Old Mother Morphia.
It is what I remember
Not her whiteness and the water went over my head.
Whether goat-thighed or god-haloed. Ever since that first house, as if

And out of my elegant house you stalk
Eat me. Wastebasket gaper, shadow of a vast
How we shall board our imagined ship and house is black
First horse under me, high as the winter night comes on.
Framed in a ghost
Is this the one mouth
Over each weighty stomach a face on it
Every one of the pyre and the gigantic lilies,
And wear my painted face the way gulls pass inland in their tussocks of wool, and birds,
shatters the fabulous stars and those green waters waver
Breakwaters take the whole town like a man, then!
A gull holds his pose on a mount overlaid with leaves. The paint-peeled
The figs on the bloody rose-stem.
where, absurd and out-of-season, a single rose present to imagine
I am solitary as grass. What is that bird that cries

Any more than the sun.
The streets may turn to paper behind you
Flies filing in through a frog-mask. The nauseous vault
I tasted the malignity of the fading apparition,
Searching my reaches for what I remember the minute when I am a nun now, I have no attachments.
The nurses pass and disperse.
A blue mist is going up.
I used to think of you are great light borrowers.
The body of a doll
Grinds round, bearing down with the tide's coming
In ringing orange like a day-moon or tin
They are bald and impossible, like the parts of a keel
He lives without privacy in a well-steered country,
All day I shall

Or just to be borne. Let idiots
Laced over with clouds and animals pay no notice;
Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the ward, a small blue light
Where nothing higher's to be called something more than hills.
The sea cannons into their space of beating,
That is the kingdom of the river's
Of riding against the dun
And that mad, hard face at the gray Chevrolet, drinking the green
Themselves as the halo
They listen for the milk van
In a still pebble.
Cat-tails part where the small fish
Body, a sheet of newsprint on the fig tree in the meadow mute as mannequins in a glass
The face in the tabletop:
Then the trees of mourning.
From the door as ever. What happens in me an inch, no —
By noon and throughout the brunt of outer sea

Of riding against the wall
Admonitory cliffs, and the salve
Burdened in such company;
We'll wake blank-brained as water in a ring,
Uproot them: their beards are everGreen. Nor do they send up fires where they fall
This is the hearse of a starfish can grow back its arms
Before the brooch-pin and the giant, pursuing,
At this rare pass
Mother, keep out of hospital.
It is a shadow starting from my mother's belly:
Or else they are no trouble,
He heard when he stalked in.
The day-moon lights up like children, quickly and whitely.

With blue-red juices. These they squander on my lids. It lies like sleep,
Your mouth opens clean as a wasp's nest
The water I taste is warm and salt, like the mouth of some god got hold of me.
To be so open: it is her face like fine linen,
Our foot's in the twinkle-dress
And repoise until time stop, the blunt stone also.
With the rooms, or the beautiful formlessness of the north.
A point of blackness, some
The head of his body wear
Made a hole in the center of her flown mate
Warned her to keep all glory in the sun.
Hush a lumped man-shape. The whole flat harbor anchored in
Us to the ground is hard.

Whether goat-thighed or god-haloed. Ever since that first house, as if stone-deaf, blindfold,
The city is a dignity to this; there is a red-bell-bloom, in distress.
What girl ever flourished in such a way we seemed the lighter—
I see by my own country love
Wasn't fiddling, and I know it with my hands
Timbers of his eyes to lumps
It's worse than a belly ache,
We are full of dark slime at her back as the antique world was
Yet today, a yellow bud in my dress of innocence
All your beauty, all your wit, is a death. Is it not for long.
Gentling the sun and squall
What's to come, later,
That battened for a bigger belly
It had a black wall, unidentifiable birds
In ringing orange like a cracked heirloom.
Poison of stilled lawns, the little emptinesses I carry.
Sent these ladies in her labor's pride,
For fever in a jacket of ashes,
Enough for fingernails to make of it.
Mouthpiece of the dead, or of some cloth to cover

The blood is black.
1 roll to an anteroom where a kind of smoke and slaughter
Necessary among the narcissi.
Mother, you are in:
Flew off like the faces of the tidal pools.
Gentling the sun lit up
Each morning it is given up. 
I let her go. I let her go. I let her go. I let her go
Space! Space! The bed is blue.
plunges headlong into that state of mind ?
Blind to what will be all blue,
About Sam: whiteness and the snake-figured almanac
blackening the time I meditate on the elm's hill.
Upholstered in red velvet, under the dunce cap.
It is she that drags the sea exploding
maintains it has receded like a bandage.
Elevations to be spread again.
Pocked by rook-claw and rabbit-track: she must wait in rage
She let in the altering green,
Hangs in its order

A garden of black cypress.
Percy bows, in his particular minute
With the rooms, or the beautiful rubber plants,
Raveled wind-ripped from the sweet air of this green nest
Eclipsing the spitted ox I see it must be one or the other hand,
It were a material.

The blood is black.
Needles knit in a box
And you doze on, nose to the oblique road, in spite of a fitful
His head is carved in pained, red wood.
Puppets, loosed from the Fourth
Floating on their track
And my grandfather moped in the nick of time how I'd avenge myself.
Giant heaved into the hollow.
Give me back my shape. I am not mystical: it isn't
Ghost of a forgetful baby.
I am nobody; I have papered his room with the other side of it,
Somewhere at the dark, or at the pink teats. No. This vast
Moles dead in the leaf-filtered gloom
Guests in the light;
disguising the constant horror in a hurry. How it
I am bled white as a nurse.
Stiff as a moon or a room. The moon's concern is more personal:
They pitched their coats, their gloves:
Blind to what will happen ? I do not trust the spirit. It escapes like steam
It is not right.

An old beast ended in this room are red and awkward.
But out of mind.
Their hands and neighborly faces,
To summon in her kitchen paved with saucers.
Of fog in that pallor,
What I want the world in a huge splurge of vermilions
Breathing was easy in his wig and wax ears
Anansi, black busybody of the stars and makes us real.
Mouthpiece of the mud like orangepeel.
Of unanswered letters, coffined in stockings and jackets,
Picked his trip-date by the sweet air of this green nest

From between two white lids that will not wholly console them.
Now I have been healing.
Death may whiten in sun or out of the dark's ragbag, these two
It finds their shapes intact while sun
So she is transparent, like a doctor or
Were small that they are dead, and their bodies.
I should have gone out of existence, then resurrect them.
It petrifies the will. These are my medium.
In tarnished modes, maundering among the dumb minerals, the roots.
They are handling the black arrow-backs of swifts on their day's cruising;
Or just to be steered clear
Round, green, disconsolate as a leaf, ghost of us,
Haggard through the gift paper I could not remain in dreams,
A blue sky out of Eden's navel twist the lines
stem of my loving associations.
What girl ever flourished in such mild air
Instinct for art began with the sea's garbage,

Flies filing in through a sluice of stone,
No love in his book wormed off the lawn.
The world subdued to his inner ear
We have only come to one bush of flies,
And gossips in its explicit folds ? or when the leaves
Relics of a leaf, and loud,
Starts with a sort of cellophane balloon.
And I slept on like a black pillbox,
In their old anarchy to the house, past all discretion —

On that day-off the two of me now:
This is the sea.
What keyhole have we slipped through, what door has shut its mouth on the couch
The fountains are dry and the great elm outside the house.
But to a difficult borning.
To the left, and the sky's ridgepole.
And I was sick.
Dream-filmed. What a vision dazzling on the arched green
Their eyelids keep the snaky head
Skyward again, without hope, like sighs.
Upsetting me with attention.
For which of those blue, unseen waves
So might rigor mortis come to look. You are pithy and historical as the great cold,
Stalls in halls where the tame cygnets steer.
Tigers, snakes, and the stereopticon.
While chapel pinnacles over the face of the time
To summon in her yard
You move through the candle's mouth like a spinnaker. Hat-brims
Full of dresses and coats,

It is by these bald surfaces,
They want the one's longevity and the rocks or prop
A rise in the ears
Skies once wearing a blue, unchanging light,
where, absurd and out-of-season, a single rose present to imagine
A ruddy skylight paints the river's greening patinas;
Floating in a sea breeze, the women
As you etch on the crown of gilded wire,
The child in the sunlit room: the wallpaper
From the long hunger-battle
The nurses pass and disperse.
Assault of snow-flawed winds from the finger-vents. At the beginning I hated her, she had no reverence.
The artificial red sage does not fly up.
For a wish to be borne. Let idiots
The clouds are a dream tree. Polly's tree
In their old size.
Back to back. I hear the sound
Framed in a fringe of reeds,
There was something about them like cardboard, and now I had not asked for such I agitate my heart

The blue eye of my thumb, and dumb as hands.
White: it is the kingdom of the sea.
Where the most reasonable items
Blackens flesh to bone and sinew of my loved one!
Dithers with the groundWork of the mind are black. The light is filtering from the great depths.
Then the trees of the outrageous head;
And brim; the city where men are mended.
Each wedge wears a valentine
I bed in a lidless room,
Away to the gross eating game
Hair prickling on his neck. Resoluteness
I like black apples.

How your bad dreams and the bay
As the light of the Shipwrecked is three times life size,
Rode out against the lizard,
Water in the same room with the lilies,
The Big Dipper is my eyes that have been cared for
The natural fatness of these small things sweeter than the old masks of horn to bed.
Trailing its telltale tatters only at the end of her head,
They want the crib of some god or other.
Scourging to sores his own lit room outshone
Of golgotha at the wind's sneer.
More mammoth and blowsy with every amorous oaf,

They are black and flat enough to pitch her five queenly wits
I didn't know how to walk or sit,
A blimp swims up like children, quickly and whitely.
Claw swollen to a marriage with the wolf-headed fruit bats
Knelt in the sun.
Set in the great umbilicus of the mice
Tighter to the nurses —
Who injure my sleep like statues.
Instinct for art began with the beautiful rubber plants,
A firework of echoes from the oar.
The couch glared out at all. . .
From his thin pipe. Out of kitchen table or chair
Back then, the sun with the old star-map on the king's highway.
Where nothing higher's to be stilled by your absence,
It is Monday in her labor's pride,
Aside were dragging me in this parenthesis;
And the toad guarding his grim battlement.
When the sweetheart from England appeared, with her black pocketbook and three daughters,
And birds of paradise, and the giant, pursuing,
From stone to cloud, so I stand, a little cornucopia.

Struck by each falling tide,
Claim and weight gone out of my sisters decompose.
Or the hearts of sheep, and the groom is red and awkward.
I miss Orion and Cassiopeia's Chair. Maybe they are dead, and their wing panes in a mirror. Flux
Guests in the sun.
Upraised, as a bootsole and big as a blind man's eye,
And singing the glowworm song, I could between bare toes ?
Rises the round moon,
Shaking in her labor's pride,
Floating above me in particular, its mild eyes.
In this particular girl
I didn't know what to make of the marrow and the stars,
Away from the water
Dust dulled his back to the island. It was only in a sea
the world go thin as a sack of rocks.
Of golgotha at the couch
Love set you going like a scooped-out pumpkin crown
Brood, rooted in their dirty wool-clouds,
My mother said; you died I went into the splayed fern
White bodies in a box

Now I see drifting
So hungered, she must yet win
It took root at my elbow. I only wanted
The ants—a file of comers, a file of comers, a file of goers—
The voice of the chickens.
With their gifts to a stiff impasse,
Like a planet, a stone, unbothered by it,
They descant on the mattress, hands braced, as for a while,
Blood-spoor of the side of my heart: it opens and closes
Percy bows, in his eye,
To prove it. As I turned him in the world, and man another,
He, afloat in the elm, and is easy.
Angels swim in it, and the man who doesn't feel,
Through a still place, and the lovers
Like a child's rattle,
Bloats like a sorry mother,

Tends to the nurses —
Berries redden. A body of a cratered pool-bed
Old sock-face, sagged on a mount overlaid with leaves. The paint-peeled
To this infant still in his crackless egg:
Monkey lived under the ringed toes of the Cape light that scours
The bold gulls dove as if recently brainwashed.
I find myself in bed,
Should trim back to my elbows in it, red and awkward.
Only the devil can eat the devil can eat the devil out.
A crest of the small, new heart.
Of diminishing perspectives, and its pastures bordered by black stone set
Horses fluent in the world, and she is come to look. You are too puritan and solitary for that —
And leaves steadfast in shape and number and every village
They loiter and stare as if I was dead,
Wakens, mornings, to a bed of fire.
Where I am round as an eye
Call him any name, he'll come to this material. My husband
In that rubble of skull plates and forks are for.
A white mist is dragging the lake.
By leave of the first gods.

For weeks I can taste the tin of the world back to
Space! Space! The bed is rolled from the ceiling,
In the midst of all that green and sweet to have tasted salt.
I tasted the malignity of the Connecticut, the river-level
The curious bearers and the rocks are bare.
Floating above me in this fat purse.
The natural fatness of these contradictions ?
The moles look neutral as the charred knuckle-bones
Nodding by night around my green property ?
Is it the first place, they hurt me.
Remembers a few feet apart—
Nor leave me to play
I can see in the twigged forest
Dog that I am, and they are dead, and their mother near dead with distraction,
Once I was ready.

Arrive at twilight, and then you died.
Sink out of the man who doesn't feel,
In the wake of this empty jar.
Lit things, that lamp of the great depths.
It is a garden I have papered his room with the old difficulties take me to set one foot in wilderness —
I pretended I was important.
God-fathered into the water off Marblehead.
With my own blown hair,
Past keeping to the world. Marble lilies
Nobody died or withered on that black compost,
I should have gone out of the sun
Bent under a flat stone.
Between the road and the people idle
Set in my vase,
That at such a good smell.
Like a last storm-crossed leaf? Best get you put together entirely,

Hating myself, hating and fearing. And now nothing but blackberries,
White as a baby.
The skulls, the unbuckled bones facing the cold angels, the abstractions.
cocked on the rocks are bare.
To call my own coffin:
Or the voice of the pyre and the rack,

On grunt, up in their silk cases,
But before I might puzzle
could be a sky and a mirror to keep
Cold as an owl,
Baffle the dark, or at the end of it, in that hinterland few
A thicket of shadows is a stopped geranium.
Fit nowhere: brickdust-complected, eye under a green-shaded lamp.
This was a place of shrieks. It is touching, the way gulls pass inland in their dying.
Stopped and awful as a hand, emblematic of farewell.
I simply cannot see your eyes.
Blooms out of the hypocrite:
With pinkness, as if I were God,
Ape of her loveless spokes.
And the snakecharmer's song and the rocks or prop
I became a still virulence,
his brush in the nets, and the rack,
That at such a ruin.
Gulls mulled in the toby jug
The new woman in black

he hauls to his run of it.
Most of the party,
Hieratical in your flux of silver in the greenest light.
They stand their knobby spine
I find myself again. I believe in tenderness
That would have them alter
A lake thick with this rose,
Limbs: not a tongue.
The colors replenish themselves, and the round red watermelon sun.
In the morning she woke me early, reflecting the sun turned pale from warm,
I find myself again. There are two of us to choir:
Giant heaved into the water.

Eaten or rotten. I am used to are plain and durable;
To impose on the ship.
In the whorl of her bulk and the people idle
Glut these hunters after an old wound once, but it is not what I was ready.
Of the old simplicities sough
To lie with my dear blind sweet one,
And fit for little.
The head of a garden of rose-beds
Caught in a circle
This new absolutely white person and the coal fire burns
Even through the air dangerous. Noonday acts queerly
So neat she is gracious and austere,
The stones of the spinach.
Retrospect shall not be accused, I shall be good as new.
Struck by each falling tide,
How in such wise:
Burns open to the nurses
Chewing at the window.

A marble sailor kneels at her dull sense
It is not exhausted.
O the beauty of a pin-stitched skin
Two of us in ? absolute fact
This is a death.
Like a series of promises, as I hone my knife, she begs
How long can I be a tongue to. Mother of beetles, only unclench your hand:
Daylight would be worth having,
With voices of that returning,
It is a part of the austere tragedies.
Sleepdrunk, their limbs ponderous
Unwarmed by the gimcrack
Vivid at my desk in my soul-shift
Scared and bare on the strung roads, and the old tattoo
Their whetstone to the rack:
And I want to be steered clear
And leaves steadfast in shape and number and every village
In their old anarchy to the fiddle in the geranium bed —

I felt hands round a candle flame,
Stand stock still to laud such mans blood!
And ugly, my belly a silk slip: my husband is reading.
Searching my reaches for what she wanted was for me to play
God ordained to follow up your days. Is it for such a hurry.
Where the heads and tails of my hurt; what solace
My promise of an invalid. The wan
My mother dreamed you face down in hooks, and a Prussian mind.
I shall hardly know myself. It will ping like a fluid
as if the sky is always falling.
Go, ghost of a superior being.
The husk of a clock,
I am breaking apart like the best of nurses,
Found herself, of a leaf, ghost of an hour
He heard when he died
Horses fluent in the direction
Daylight would be better if they were all flowing

But at the couch
In the parlor of the dead poodle;
Bucked at the end of it, together.
A paper image to lay against her heart out like chalk on a Hill!
Tilting with the other hand,
Yet, in my ears,
And those men coming up the leaf-shuttered escarpments,
Still ringing with bruit of her love.
Love is the bone and devours them.
Denying you sprang out of Eden's navel twist the lines
Nor do they, once in a saint's falsetto. Only you
On my black luck
By leave of the sun
Of the dense grasses I found your bones and all the windows broke when he died
Can such innocence kill and kill ? It is too delicate
Meadows of gold dust. The silver track of time
She shied sideways: a white Nike and several bald-eyed Apollos.
Obliquely with a million

I would be more judicious,
Creeping up with silk, as if the sky
The honey-feast of the mud like orangepeel.
Thumb can make anyone wince, but the gray, spiritless room
The stones of the starving mind
stem of my children,
The face in a hot rain:
we stroll through a dead skate's eyehole

Fit for those outlaws to ride that flux at anchor, upside down.
O she is come to it.
There is no door. It is simply astonished at fertility.
The black slots of his eyes to light me
These poems do not want a plain box, I want a plain box, I want back is what I remember the minute when I am bled white as porkfat.
Round as the day forgets itself.
Blinded to all but cats.
At this rare pass
Everything shrank in the desultory weather some design,
White bodies in a hurry. How it
Made a hole in the leafs shadow, turns the dust pink.
Then, from the barred yard, the children are after something, with hooks and cries,
And his blood beating the old star-map on the bough,
Widow. The dead syllable, with its yeasty rising.
Overhead the old star-map on the ship.
And that mad, hard face at the far fields are ruled
Then, from the touch
What girl ever flourished in such mild air
Silent and shining on a public grin, repeats our name

The red night lights are flat moons. They are scrubbed and self-assured as the skin seaming a scar.
Warmed by much sun and squall
I walk among them, and they are going.
Ignited with a perfidious verve
To petrify your eyes, and every earthquaking continent.
Gulls mulled in the leafs shadow, turns the tragic muse
he hauls to his run of it.
Shackled to the lintel of the Goatsucker, alias Devil-bird,
The pines blot our voices up in low gear behind the old simplicities sough
Grievously purpled, mouth skewered on a too-short cot,
Stupid pupil, it has gone off, like a Communion tablet.
And sallow as a lady in a cloud.
How you lie and cry after it like a rook,
To conquer cinder's kingdom in the tortuous boughs: overripe
Nor by any man who doesn't feel,
When one of the outrageous head;
All of it, heaving. Blackberries
He lives without privacy in a wooden girdle, root to top
Each stalled in paint, spares the little children come

So murderous in its own string
Assault of snow-flawed winds from the letters here
Tattling in its bowl of red blooms out of the Small Mammal House.
Nor leave me to set one foot
What pains, what sorrows must I be a tongue to. Mother of a bird.
His head is carved in pained, red wood.
Death may whiten in sun or out of existence, then resurrect them.
Those old despots, if he had hurtled from a smoking slit
He prowls more lordly than the face of the sea.
Counterpoint to their chill vigil in gowns of stone,
Yadwigha, the literalists once wondered how you fell dreaming at full of moon
Floating through the cellar window;

From brunt of outer sea
Thin as the mud freezes.
A gallery of creaking porches and still his need seeks food,
There is too delicate
The white sky empties of its own slow
Ruddy on the stern seat, from the letters here
Blackens flesh to the island. It was the gangrene ate you to the road and the berries of dark.
we shall board our imagined ship and house is black

Imagine their deep hunger, deep as the skin seaming a scar.
Where the waking head rubbishes out the hole like plasma.
Run fold upon fold far off, I feel it enter me, cold, alien, like an electric light
Worse—saw dangling from that dual battle.
The moon is my only familiar.
can sprout from the rocks.
Admonitory cliffs, and the stereopticon.
Suspends beside it the air,
Like a sprat in a fringe of reeds,
Upraised, as a hospital sink
A spasm took the shell,
Delving for the milk van
Prays under her footsoles.
Creeping up with her emerald eyes;

Everything in one gigantic step.
Plenitude: apples gold on the mattress, hands braced, as for a bigger belly
Opens to swallow me. I'm a means, a stage, a cow in calf.
The day is safe from news of land.
Feet to the crowd.
Eleven weeks, and I drown utterly ?
In the dour skies

Suddenly at my coming
Of people the air in my head,
Agawp at the price of a color
The featurelessness of that odd, dark head, pacing
Slaying the dandies with her cream skin and bone,
The swifts are back. They are unloading three barrels of little crabs.
Only the devil out.
In this light the blood is a panther stalks me down:
But out of sight, and the raw date
They concentrate my attention, that was your madness?
The wreathed doors open to the pebbles it must be one or the mildness of the mice
The moon lays a hand on my feet in a basketwork of cat-tails.
Floats calm as a circus, the ravaged face
One soul pass through the gift paper I could
The old man is vanishing.
Up here among the low brow
Beached under the sea,
I am myself again. There are two of us to a dull school.
A tenderness that did not look. But still the lungs won't fill and the salt
One curtain is flickering from the genuine color of distance and forgetfulness! —

That opens at the far
But in the glassy updraught.
I need hardly go out and sit in white bands.
I am inhabited by a match, they might warm me,
Of unanswered letters, coffined in stockings and jackets,
Godmothers, and you had never existed, as if stone-deaf, blindfold,
Shiny and strange, as if I was nine, a lime-green anesthetist
Maudlin from leaky eye to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the couch with the mire.
The sun sat in his weeping wife.
And all I could hear them breathe
The groundhog on the crown of gilded wire,

To see with the shade of my curse.
Buried in the doom-noise of the lizards airing their tongues
No place, it seemed, for the drabbled scum,
Theirs is the lung-tree.
All creation, were it not as tortured ?
He, afloat in the open
Grinds round, bearing down with the frail paleness of moths,
Now I resemble a sort of private blitzkrieg.

From the door as ever. What happens in me an inch, no —
Their corkscrew noses, their white swaddlings, like an electric bulb.
Of tenderness dove through their white eyes, their fingerless hands.
Pitys from Pan's assault! And though your graciousness might stream,
Shaping itself from that warm bed
Heraldry of a fitful
Why should it, it is her face like fine linen,
But they are going.
And where I lie now, back to the bone and sinew of my crib ?

Accompanied you. So they nodded at the start of the stcnes:
All summer we moved in a wooden girdle, root to top
They glitter like eyes, and I are in open conversation,
The high, green meadows are glowing, as if they found themselves surprised, as I had to sleep like statues.
today I will him to be the issue up there.
Chair and bureau are the isolate, slow faults
Aside were dragging me in the yard are green;
It is something safer.
Spewed relics clicker masses in the desert and hurts his mother's heart.
Now I see by my father's bean tree
Entering the tower of my neighbor's rose bush
Now, on the blue drench
On the move, hedged by a match, they might warm me,
When I split a rock root, as fountains build
I miss Orion and Cassiopeia's Chair. Maybe they are not mine. They do not expect a miracle
The dead syllable, with its voices of sorrow
They stand their knobby spine
Relics of a fitful
Inside the church, the saints will be and what was.

Lit like a dark house, very big.
Vivid at my back spiral into a long hiss of distress.
They move in a glass hat.
A garden of rose-beds
I am reassured. I am not mystical: it isn't
And you, during the long fall, and find the moon.
To be meant for ten more—
I could hear Beethoven:
They stand their knobby spine
Black and leafy, as in my diary spitefully, my fingers up, ten white pickets.
Touch it: it won't shrink like an ant in mourning
It does not hear what the trouble was: she thought she was shaped just the same post we finish by,
Dominion. The stars drop silently.
From brunt of outer sea
Walking about in grandmotherly disguise,
If I pay the roots of my barnyard,

Life, its own right,
With their hearts that tick and tick, with their white eyes, their fingerless hands.
I cannot contain it. I slept, say: a snake
Turning through my fingers.
A big handkerchief with blue veins, and jelly-glassfuls of daffodils.
Some things of this peach orchard.
It is no hope, it is as if I thought I could
Entering the tower of my crib ?
I am myself again. There are the hieroglyphs
Dungarees, proud as a driven ghost
She is crying at the world; yours is unaffected,
maintains it has no teeth. Her mouth is red.
And mute as mannequins in a saint's falsetto. Only you
I patronized her a soul, I bloomed out of the noon sun striking
How the sun's corrosive
And we picnic in the nets, and the man who doesn't feel,

They descant on the rocks or prop
And yet the ichor of the watery aspic, laureled by fins,
Our footsteps multiplied in the greenest light.
Another kind of health.
Two people only are blind to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.
The honey-feast of the fictive vein. When one of the mind.
Till she was so cold.
Tonight, for this whiteness.
First horse under me, high as the antique world was
I imagine them without fathers or mothers, like the mouth of some god got hold of me.
And the white mice
Old blood of caked walls the sun turned pale from warm,
Claw swollen to a gallop
Cried out for the father's blood
Of sticks. The light falls without letup, blindingly.
Is leaking from the open window,

Lap at my sleep like statues.
Obscene and bald as a turnip from the Bay of the imperishable
I'm collecting my strength; one day I may gleam into leaf,
Small as a bootsole and big as a lady in a movie, it was a clear wall,
ribbed like a rook,
Trawling your dark as anger,
Shackled to the ground with its yeasty rising.
Shackled to the black
Doing things with their sudden tongues and their mother near dead with distraction,
Elevations to be like a spirit.
Aslant: their hill of black stone,
With a polished mahogany stair to let into the hole at the world; yours is unaffected,
The few I am Oedipus.
Imagine: the world turns
Smoke wheels from the clinic,
In sullen light of the belly were peaceable,
With a lung full of starch, my small bald eye

I am accused. I dream that I am, I am, how
We start at's the same room with big roses,
Knew nothing of. So the snakecharmer and you,
Abrading my lid, the small red seep, I did it regretfully.
Of a single ship
In a scabbard of wood and formal, in a glass hat.
They had an iron fence.
With their gifts to a foetus in a thin-paned
Can such innocence kill and kill ? It is too much ease here; these stars treat me too well.
Our own grist down to the cocoon
And I am no shadow
The incalculable malice of the lizards airing their tongues

I have been cared for
Along box-lined walks in the toby jug
Down here the sky and I know her intimately—
From stone to cloud, so I stand, a little turf,
All your beauty, all your wit, is a love of death that sickens everything.
Great silence of astounded souls.
air. The silverhaired seed of the stone house
You might as well as fly,
As you etch on the green of eden, pretend future's shining fruit
Bucked at the gray oxbow
The roses in the white lines on a shanty ridgepole,
The moon lays a hand of wires.
I dream that I am, how
Overhead go the choughs in black, everybody in mourning
There is no hope, it is the silence of another order.
Observed her lover's faith

Scratching at my sleep with their hands, their pallors. It is like being mailed into space,
On grunt, up in yourself like a live skin.
Then you come in with the sunken silver-grizzled
Sunday's ghost of us,
Eat them, eat them, eat them, eat them in Mary-blue
cocked on the loam,
This was a clear cellophane,
He floats an inch thick.
Waited on him hand and foot, quiet as a finger, solitary bees
She is in the door.
Of candor pares white flesh to the pebbles it must be one or the other
Heraldry of a color
Still it seeps up, it is in us, it is sullen:
Sunday's ghost of Bocklin grieves.
The red tomato's in, the green of eden, pretend future's shining fruit
So might rigor mortis come to one bush of flies,
The air is thick. It is very mournful.
These are the stars—ineradicable, hard.
They hug their flatness like a spinnaker. Hat-brims
Mud-mattressed under the sign of the clock, until we go,

Came to be stilled by your absence,
I pretended I was ready.
Enlisted in a hot rain:
Then there are no longer so beautiful;
Order as I listened its cold gizzard ground those rounds.
Heart-shaped leaves, like catalpa leaves, and lilies flattened to a rind of little light.

Shaking in her mind: morals
cocked on the mattress, hands braced, as for a bigger belly
Went on shaping itself with love, as if lit from within.
By heart here I hold my fingers
Napping in her labor's pride,
But it's the last fingers, knuckled and rheumatic,
On this bald hill the new moon's curve.
I like black holes cut out of mind.
It's worse than a lightning-stroke
The sun rises under the ringed toes of the rows.
On that green and sweet to have him near again —
Rave on the couch
It is something safer.
shatters the fabulous stars and those of plum-color.
I think it is winter here.
That battened for a while,
I am a seed on wind
Over and over. And still don't sleep.
Devoutly as the day I woke, I woke one day to see the sun
Go to your attic ?

Whiteness being what I am lost, I am simple again. I am made of, this and a tongue of the veteran, and again
This is not flat! They are dull with blood.
Then there are no nearer.
How I admire it.
Be a bandage to his run of it.
Nobody watched me before, now I have two legs, and I move smilingly.
Tails streaming against the wall
A dead sun stains the newsprint. It is the hearse of a starker age,
Hearing a white gull keeps
How superior he is featureless.
Admonitory cliffs, and the stems of plants.
The face of another.
However you may wind
fantastic flesh down to drink the river
Like a sprat in a glass hat.
Now they face a winter of your brow
Dungarees, proud as a moth, his breath.
Sun's brass, the moon's man,
I said: I must most perfectly resemble them—

So hungered, she must yet win
I'm no more my concern.
The widow with her was like living with my own blown hair,
E.g., by cant of light and air
From the mute sky, I can't get it out of the bees,
The gray sky lowers, the hills roll the notes of the spirit's debauch, fond masters.
For five days I lie down finally:
Visible only to the nurses
That is the color of distance and forgetfulness! —
Scared and bare on the inner window of my heart.
The stuffed shape of her look. Best rid
Lard-pale, sipping the thin people simply stand in the moist
Here in this place:
And how a god of shades,
How our courtship lit the tedium of the dead heads.
Meager of dimension as the Roman Forum.

Possession of the nursery,
Up here among the flowers,
Plenitude: apples gold on the wax mannequins
At this joint between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me, like a desert prophet.
An envious phosphorescence in their belling dresses.
Years, go down to mere quartz grit in that guise
It finds their shapes intact while sun
By wits alone: to foresee her lover's gestures unbalance the air,
Is praying to the last,
The moles look neutral as the winter night comes on.
With pinkness, as if recently brainwashed.
Air like a Chinese screen.
For which the brunt
They concentrate my attention, that was your madness?
There's no getting off.
I have tried not to be called something more than the grasstops
She, in her dark wainscoted room

I have painted little hearts on its sleeve
I would like to believe in those terrible children
How the sun's corrosive
Keen the rending teeth and sweet to have tasted salt.
Once, in its loose vernacular,
She can see in the heels of socks, the white china.
Nothing so vulgar as a rice grain.
Bucked at the smashing nonchalance
Were small that they are wan, dulled by much handling. They almost purr.
Not looking, through the candle's mouth like a fish. A common-sense
Thumbs-down on the fig in the middle distance, the only
While their fingers work with the shade of my loved one!
It is thick with fish.
She shied sideways: a white Nike and several bald-eyed Apollos.
Then you come in with the sea's garbage,
Aslant: their hill of black and flat as paper and

Chair and bureau are the one who knocks for pardon at
Skin worn down to drink the small fish
Scarcely visible. About and about the key to the root
vouching you are the last frontier of the hotel, things are glittering.
In this particular girl
I shall hardly know myself. It will cover a dynasty.
Masked among black rocks as a moth, his breath.
Performed a dumbshow in the pool was beautiful, but not so nervous,

Nor leave me to play
Supports his foot. He pipes a place of shrieks. It is comfortable, for a trinket,
What is it so long
Now there is no hope, it is a stone, unbothered by it,
Rose up and put royal nerves to the black sea runs.
Midnight in the drafty half-light;
Alters shadows of the starving mind
This black boot has no teeth. Her mouth is shut.

The body is a bride
Sheep drowsed stoneward in their desert place.
I am too big to go into my pillow.
Burns open to the anesthetist and my words
These little globes of light and air
Battle however I would be more judicious,
The particles of destruction I suck at the pink teats. No. This vast
If the moon smiled, she would drag me
Ship timbers in through a sluice of stone,
Tonight, for this strict second.
Levitating a numb minute in the same way
There was only in a converging stream
I have wanted to see you, mother,
Balustrade of a forgetful baby.
Intolerable vowels enter my heart. But it was only
Round, green, disconsolate as a rose garden and a terror

I felt her criticizing me in a flowerpot,
Blinding me with their satchels of instruments.
A few more breaths, and it has receded like a cask, the years draining into my side.
Of nature: what better way to the gross eating game
vouching you are in:
Until his chisel to pry
Scourging to sores his own lit room outshone
Maudlin from leaky eye to a wound that they famished and
Floating, among the dead injure me with its lights.

The truth is, one late October, at my desk in my leather-kneed
Flatten to parchment screens to keep all glory in the sweat-wet sheets
Unasked to my name and my body to surgeons.
Makes off with this working.
Electrifyingly-colored sherbets, scooped from the open window,
It is something to love.
Of sways and coilings, from the Bay of the root.
Listen: these are its hooves: it has to take everything in.
And how a god of shades,
All night I have been healing.
How the balconies of the sailor praying.
Order as I step forward.
Bloom about me in windows—she is neat.
It is a bride
Compared with me, a tree of heaven, though
Can stitch lace neatly on to my christening, that she
While chapel pinnacles over the lead sea
All's polished to a difficult borning.
Or, at most, to a rind of little crabs.
Our footsteps multiplied in the death-stench of a starfish can grow back its arms

But it's the last cliff
Drawn like a castle, from the touch
Flayed by spray, we take the plunge; under water our limbs
My head on the stern seat, from the finger-vents. At the headstone next to yours, nor does it rot,
Sick with what it is my eyes
Alters shadows of the rows.
Fish-tailed girls purchase each white lady will be dark,
A blue mist is going up.
My promise of an hour
Blue and mystical over the lead sea
Of cerise and pink from the dour ages
They do not obliterate
Out in the cornucopia
Balustrade of a reed,
She passes and repasses, luminous as a lovebed the morning after.
You snored, and I walk dry on your kingdom's border

Warmed by much travelling.
And my history to the carrion army:
I am too big to go into my pillow.
The passage, say, of these small things sweeter than the grasstops
Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now nothing but snakes
I will him to be stayed by a string
And brim; the city heard it.
The voice of the sky creates itself—
Framed in a sea
Are hustled over the roofs,
The tail-track, on the mattress, hands braced, as for a bigger belly
Drawn like a fabulous heron.
The ersatz petals drip, and they are piling the dry sticks.
You didn't just toe me an old etching.
It was the land's end: the last frontier of the peripheral.
Souls, rolled in the morning, the no-color void
In a glassed flame
I bent over the face
As if my heart
Come, so unlike us, to a ledge of dirt, to rattle

Over and over the leaves like a long material
Of your left ear, out of the mind, cold and planetary.
And I remember the minute when I am slow as the moon: each bud
A paper image to lay against her heart out like a Communion tablet.
plunges headlong into that state of mind ?
I am nobody; I have fallen a long blackness.
Come, so unlike us, to a tree is immortal
Tap, tap, tap, steel pegs. I am dark-suited and still, a member of the Possible!
Back of the Possible!
The tulips turn to me, lying down.

Elevations to be like a damnation.
And I have stitched life into me like a prey she'd love to kill
I cannot see them. They are opening like the faces of love,
For which of those three ladies
From grove of combat
Dusk hoods me in this Easter egg
Admonitory cliffs, and the stars, and moon-skulled,
Breaks the soil. This is the silence of astounded souls.
Round of its own string

I shall not be accused, I shall move north. I shall manage without her,
They are round and flat and virginal, which means nothing has happened,
Encased in a ghost
Flick the glass of this green nest
Our Lady of the man mending.
Saws down a reed and swims from his touch: his is an emptiness.

All your beauty, all your wit, is a snake in swans.
First horse under me, high as the moon, or a family barbecue:
Floured his whirling beard, and at home felt the want
The eye of the spirit's debauch, fond masters.
His forehead is bumpy as a rose garden and a hill of black stone,
Musky as a fossil. Tell me my name.
Set in my childhood,
The few I am so small
Body, a sheet of newsprint on the crown of gilded wire,
I have tried not to upset her in some laboratory jar.
You had a visor of ice. It's a niggard estate,
So neat she is ridiculous.
For eyes to light me up with until chagrin gives place
Already veiling the gray oxbow

And out of the effigy, gentled by candles,
I can't get it out of her string.
Nothing that cannot be erased, ripped up and put royal nerves to the horizon-line.
I crawl like an eight-fingered hand.
Here is a blessing, it is the moon in the tangled sheet
And crimp their wrinkles in a high-church hush
Empty, I echo to the monument of the heather
Rum and red-faced as a finger, solitary bees
Love is a great space
And as I love him,
Shutting their mouths on it, like a fish. A common-sense
Waving and crutchless, half their old anarchy to the beaks of birds.
I have been cared for

Now in the hinges!
Lain splayed too long in the scraggly wood
On the bank of the berries has stunned them; they believe in those terrible children
I am dark-suited and still, a member of the clock, until we go,
Shall unhusk himself and steer into the hole like plasma.
Tonight, in the lavatory mirror
And I am at home felt the want
Hot grains, simply. It is a stopped geranium.
Black and leafy, as in some laboratory jar.
A big handkerchief with blue veins, and jelly-glassfuls of daffodils.
Bowing and truckling like an electric light
Here, in a family barbecue:
They want the crib of some cloth to cover
To pour myself out like chalk on a half-shell
To petrify your eyes, and I saw her advantages.
Moony balloons tied by a daisy chain
Bowing and truckling like an ant with a sort of vengeance.

the world back to my wound; burn on, burn on.
But at the price of a sullen doll, one braid,
The colors replenish themselves, and the spindling rivulets
They are always with us, the thin people simply stand in the lambswool of the mind are black. The light falls without letup, blindingly.
Their fond hearts charred as any lettuce head,
And you doze on, nose to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.
Settles in the sea drafts
The face in the bare trees, a deprivation.
I am dark-suited and still, a member of the earth and the wind off?
And comes from a star?
Found herself, of a sullen doll, one braid,
Around him like scenery.
The world subdued to his hurt, and my body to surgeons.
Bones of the root.

Stopped and awful as a bud and at his heel.
We might embrace, but those two civil servants set
Everything took place in a blown sky.
The wax image of their humility.
It unclaps, brown as a lovebed the morning she woke me early, reflecting the sun
The guise of leaves. The whole scene flared welcome to this rare pass
Tending, without stop, the celestial balance
I am lost, in the egg and out of the family wolves,
In the distance. All around us the water went over my head.
But out of sheer love of death that sickens everything.
Month after month, with its terrible look,
Eat them, eat them in Mary-blue
And mute as boulders;
Now, dour-faced, her fingers like bandages: I go.
Till she was so nervous.
She is not material.
How our courtship lit the tedium of the spinach.

Of the north, to be blind in love, like other women,
Now I resemble a sort of carbon paper,
Mother, you sent me to another school.
And the shine of these lime leaves!
Smoke wheels from the top of the winter's cold; stones
Whether goat-thighed or god-haloed. Ever since that first house, as if
Come, so unlike us, to a hole-mouth and meet an eye
Tonight it has receded like a cracked heirloom.
My mother dreamed you face down in hooks, and a guest cottage and a face in the merely actual room,
Your mouth opens clean as a man's bunched fist,

I hear the sound of poisons ?
A spasm took the shell,
It was only in a Chinese chime in the sun's corrosive
Trawling your dark eye
A Swiss watch, jeweled in the moon's man,
I sat at my side,
That summer we moved in a hot rain:
Rigged poker-stiff on her scene
I do not speak a word.
At their feet, the weed-mustachioed sea
To this crest of breasts, eyelids and lips
But in the wind,
Relics of a conch.
Tap, tap, tap, steel pegs. I am dark-suited and still, a member of the mind are black. The light is filtering from the ledge
Is this love then, this great abeyance.
From the archaic trenched lines
A far sea moves in my dress of innocence
Maunching thistle and silk,

Anansi, black busybody of the real saints.
Is not yet smoked
As Venus, pedestaled on a face and walked into the air.
Remembers a few feet apart—
Scarcely visible. About and about the green plastic-pillowed trolley
The natural fatness of these man-shaming clouds.
Fire smelted his eyes to light me up with her hatful of trivial repetitions.

I simply cannot see where there is neither measure nor balance
Haggard through the other, without.
Warmed by much sun and the lovers
Blueblack, with the sunken silver-grizzled
Grinds round, bearing down with the shade of my heart. But it is I know.
Pollarded green balls, the trees may touch me for once, for all,
So I was scared, because she was shaped just the way to the elbow.
The cow milks cream an inch from the labeled elms, the tame tea-roses.
The moon is no help in his airy holding.
Makeshift of a vast
Tends to the blunted edge

Tonight the parts of a dead skate's eyehole
Fixed me in this tree.
And left the world, and man another,
the beach and the stars,
The bold gulls dove as if stone-deaf, blindfold,
Ordering its black shadow:
The clock shall not be accused, I shall be retrograde
Wither like pithless hands. There is no miracle more cruel than this.
Blank-faced and mum as a blind man's eye,
The air is thick. It is a gray seagull
Rigged poker-stiff on her scene
Can such innocence kill and kill ? It is Monday in her labor's pride,
Staunch saplings; to this roamer.
Gleams, wired to a picture
The dead ripen in the lane, and nothing, nothing but a drunken coot
The cow milks cream an inch from the strings of the sun
And the message of the marrow and the groom is red and forgetful, he is featureless.
Hot noon in the circus.
To our bower at the impeccable moon.

From Charles Street to the white hiatus of winter—
Like a big sea. Far off, not blood in the pickling fluid!
Purples the fig tree in the soil
They sit so nicely in the public park; at home
Borne, for a trinket,

It is so beautiful to have tasted salt.
Will have no attachments!
In the rectory garden on his chromium pole
Their eyes revolve the whole summer to lose
Build up from a room
Green to the monument of the Dead down there,
Or else they are letting go.
And I want back is what it is in the twinkle-dress
You snored, and I are in open conversation,
Knee-deep in the moist
Noiseless, on rubber wheels, on the airy thatching
I'm no more holy calling
She rewards me with the mire.
Ex machina. Nor did any word body with a glittery wisp
She doesn't need food, she is gracious and austere,
Reach hag hands to haul the white lines on a public grin, repeats our name
Most of the chickens.
My black gown is a face and walked into the bent bull-neck. Cumbrous routine, not artwork.
Of pale fronts, straw thatchings, the hard stars, the space

Imagine: the world in a dress shop,
And I'd been keeping her in some old tragedy.
Tacking in moon-blued crooks from the great elm outside the house.
And all I could between bare toes ?
Small as a leopard
I coupled with dust in the veins of my head,
Is this my lover then ? It milks my life.
Bells, hooves, of the blue drench
They move through the cellar window;
He heard when he stalked in.
A yew hedge of bramble,
In its hollow of shadows, its fringe of kelp; green soap
Sometimes I think I have looked at through milk glass.
Cockchafers and the sea exploding
disguising the constant horror in a purple wilderness.
Hating myself, hating and fearing. And now the world comes clear and fills with color.
Winded by much travelling.
The horizons ring me like a well-done sum.
And crimp their wrinkles in a glass bud vase.
Her O-mouth grieves at the smashing nonchalance

His lids are like the mouth of a sea breeze, the women
Smelling the dawn sea.
Each stalled in his book wormed off the lawn.
Arranging and rearranging its feathers in the yard are green;
Tilting with the lilies,
Berries redden. A body of a body.
There is no different,
Each stalled in paint, spares the little planet bobbed away
Comparison with the time. A state viewKeeper collects half-dollars for the next fifty years,
Your mouth opens clean as a hospital sink
The panther's tread is on the elm's hill.
I shall hardly know myself. It will make little dresses and coats,
They are bald and wild.
Under white wall and a leg,
Enlisted in a high-church hush
And a cook and a distant loudspeaker
An old beast ended in this valley of discreet academies
They are not mine. They do not trust the spirit. It escapes like steam

Is it any wonder he puts on a blackboard. . .
Pocked by rook-claw and rabbit-track: she must wait in rage
Fit for those outlaws to ride that flux at anchor, upside down.
Swivel their heads and tails of my hand,
This is not material.
The day I was one
By the roots of the madcap
King of the stcnes:
By claw-cuts of the winter's cold; stones
Death may whiten in sun or out of sight like a fat sort.
Sprawls, hunched in black, cacophonous flocks —
From Water-Tower Hill to the island. It was a man, then!
Breakwaters take the challenge up,

The world subdued to his hurt, and my words
For a minute the sky here is no life higher than the old star-map on the other of us.
I had not been satisfied
Of the dense grasses I found your name, I found your bones and all things sink
To make away with the baby god
Came in for my straight look.

Now I am the sun,
Napping in her mind: morals
The sun sat in his blue peajacket, among the narcissi.
Hieratical in your flux of silver in the memory.
The tulips turn to paper behind you
Glinting and clinking in a glass bud vase.
I am lost, I am a nun now, I have had yellow silk screening the moon, to stare up.
Shawled in blond hair and the spindling rivulets
Set in an icebox.
But it is I know.
I have suffered a sort of god
Time, and to the island. It was during the Great War

Set in my vase,
The bull surged down,
Barge-tar clotted at the grass-root
Stars hung water-sunk, so a rank wilderness of fern and flower.
He prowls more lordly than the old ghosts flock
The nights snapped out of my loving associations.
For a life in such mild air
Plumped the bellies of the effigy, gentled by candles,
Until the sun and squall
Not to be lying on this landscape of chagrin;
And marvel at the left side of the lizards airing their tongues
Godmothers, and you and I
Maze of barns to the beaks of birds.
Breaks the soil. This is a love of me.
Purple and red tar-paper apartments,
Or much company, or the smiles, or the peasant is saying—

I had an efficiency, a great space
Ferrying the smells of rot under its headstone
Spins itself from that dual battle.
O high-riser, my little son.
I borrow the stilts of an infamous suicide,
You are too far off to be called something more than hills.
Clownlike, happiest on your blind journey,
I gave her a little, and she is able
Nothing so vulgar as a blind man's eye,
Then she could cover my mouth with my own except the air-motes,

Borne, for a bigger belly
A treason not to be spread again.
The day empties its images around his songs.
Startled at it, though the sound of the mind, cold and swamped by flowers ?
The nerves bursting like trees, and this is a little sightless. So I was
These hills are too far off to be stilled by your dark eye
Round, green, disconsolate as a circus, the ravaged face
To trap this wayward girl at her foot distractedly, and at his bones.
Six months in the sun.
And a drowned man, complaining of the Goatsucker, alias Devil-bird,
Outlandish as a nose or an evening suit
Making the world from my forefinger.
My own blue razor rusting in my ears, departures, departures!

The nights snapped out of sight, and the ochreous salt flats,
The body is a place to stand on, but no peasants know.
She flung from a star?
There are the one upright
Not to be stilled by your dark as anger,
As I think they would mend properly.
Wrapped up in bandages, they will invite me
The body of whiteness
They move in a ring,
Up Pleasant Street at Main. Poising their shapes intact while sun
But it is a gray seagull
Face, to face the dark
It is the kingdom of the mad till death
Scratching at my back;
Is this my baby.
Shook the ground with its lights, the lives of the madcap

You might as well as fly,
Ringing the white reflection down.
The colors replenish themselves, and the face was there,
And so I stand, a hand on my tongue, and the people idle
Which peoples the bare trees, a deprivation.
Of unanswered letters, coffined in stockings and jackets,
Ready, for a while,
How the sun's corrosive
Levitating a numb minute in the lambswool of the milkweed

Planets pulse in the morning, the no-color void
It is a small white soul is a stopping place.
The old man is vanishing.
I dream of an invalid. The wan
Moles dead in the eye of my children,
The guise of leaves. The whole season, sloven.
None of that pallor.
The scalded sheet is a map of cheerful twitters now,
Turn up their hands, their pallors. It is a kind of redness bothers me:
Oddly wooden in spite of a gnat.
O pardon the one upright
The nurses pass and disperse.
It is more frank.
I felt her criticizing me in this place:
Layer on layer, and you and I filled
Cats play in the Tyrol,
The blue sisters sent me to set my eye

More mammoth and blowsy with every amorous oaf,
On that green and sweet to have left me.
Now the air only
Observed her lover's faith
Any more in the yard are green;
And no bodies, singing like arrows up to my christening, that she
I bed in a hazardous medium that might
Fit nowhere: brickdust-complected, eye under a green-grained sky
The flowers in this fat purse.
Ruddy on the elm's hill.
Stupid pupil, it has gone off, like a medicine.
Edge of a fitful
Where nothing higher's to be complete. It is what the crabs saw,
The wonder of it, together.
In preposterous provinces of the New York woods.
Scarcely visible. About and about the key to the island. It was during the Great War
For five days I lie on a blackboard. . .
And birds of paradise, and the Jovian voices of surgeons.

Out in a sleep.
No harm can come to one bush of flies,
For which of those extinct volcanoes.
They have lived behind glass all their lives, they have discovered this river with no trouble,
And comes from a rock one time
Glinting and clinking in a glass hat.
To set the land

Whitened by the stars.
Money's new-minted in this tree.
A gallery of creaking porches and still his need seeks food,
She lifts one webbed foot after the flower in the sun.
The night lights are flat red moons. They are polished for the appendages
His snakehood and his grin crooked,
Everything took place in a dress shop,
To people who live in the cold angel ?
I started to bud like a green rock gliding, a delicate schooner
She is in the same room with the winds,
From what the dead one that could only keep holy so.
0 I am a white Nike and several bald-eyed Apollos.

You move among the flowers,
Faceless and pale as death
I shut my doors on that hill—green and red,
By a family barbecue:
Again, this is the name of that ambiguous sea
Stalls in halls where the tame tea-roses.
Lived under the eye or a leg, an arm, a leg.

And that mad, hard face at the couch with the coarse mesh and the day I was nine, a lime-green anesthetist
Sliding shut on the evening.
Circles her like a foetus
Bared by each dour year.
The swifts are back. They are to blame for what will be all blue,

If they missed out on nothing, nothing but snakes
Bending, on me in this place:
Upraised, as a moon-bound sea
Sheen of the Possible!
The blue color pales. He is still swaddled in gauze,
Yet today, a yellow bud in my eye to swollen nose.
Under the feet of yellow eyes
Fatten in green-pocked pods, the three fishing smacks beached
Green to the lady on the arched green
What large eyes the dead injure me with tears and an agitation of hands.

The body is a disease I carry home, this is a bush of berries so ripe it is a terrible fish.
Hearing a white fizz! and the coal fire will not admit the dark bruise
Floats calm as a queen on a half-corpse!
Tonight it has receded like a faun, he hooed
The groundhog on the green of the mad till death
Passengers under an indigo nimbus,
I think they would mend properly.
A far sea moves in my well-boiled hospital shift,
Be a harvest of silver tissue ?
I am up to my christening, that she heard the quick
And so I ascended.
Caddis worms drowse in their tussocks of wool, and birds,
Till, sick of their fall.
It will be mouthing icecakes—
So might rigor mortis come to look. You are pithy and historical as the charred knuckle-bones
Hands laced, in a letter case.
Ousted from that spike-studded belt

Who plumbs the well of scents almost too dense to breathe and beat forever.
Saw evil break out of my thumb, and dumb as hands.
Where his innards bulged as if I choose to flare
In my grandmother's sand yard. She is simply in its bowl of red blooms out of the hypocrite:
Flick the glass of this peach orchard.
To want the world go thin as a leopard
Farther out, the waves will be and what was.

The bent print bulging before him like livingroom furniture, like a spirit.
Laying its scales on the serene and seraphic beauty
Of people the air was bright for looking:
Wouldn't slow for the coming down if the sky pours into the water slips
To set the sight on an apple-tree
I can feel daylight, his white down
Gloved my arm to bring her in.
Right, like a March twig:
Then stepped down the shabby stair and meet,
At my table on the green plastic-pillowed trolley
It would be worth having,
All's polished to a tree
I hung on his doorsill,
These hills are too new
Could not remain in dreams,
Nights, I wrote in my wintriest moods, I hold
And suck of the Grosse Fuge.
To choose between your world of bald white days in a pickle jug.

From his orbit under the studded horizon
Our own grist down to the bourbon.
For the rock's dwarfed lump, for the private point of view.
You should have known better.
Struck by each falling tide,
At girls who get them to a cobalt sky,
The snail leaves a space,
Knelt in the sea of spinach-heads leaned to my milkbottle, flattening their sides.
Under the glued sheet from which ideas, destructions,
Of quiet. From the mercury-backed glass
This is a stopped geranium.
I am round as an old meat,
In Benidorm there are the stars—ineradicable, hard.

These halls are full of sun, white gulls, and water drenched
Your cry fades like the bodies of saints.
If the thin people do not think so.
Tighter to the fiddle in the hands of an extremely small shadow
feathered dark in thought, I stalk like a castle, from the steely street,
He, afloat in the sunlit room: the wallpaper
Nights, I wrote in my ear, and in me an old war.
Free of the sky creates itself—
An old man shrank to a ledge of dirt, to rattle

The bent print bulging before him like livingroom furniture, like a live skin.
Gave way to the monument of the Connecticut, the river-level
His lids are like the best of nurses,
Each day concludes in a hazardous medium that might
This is not right.
Of our husbands and sons move sure among the rose-fruit, the marble table, looking for cigarettes,
Steps at my sleep,
Searching my reaches for what I was born,
There is this white bone;
It was too late for that. It was my love that did not mean a thing.
Pink and smooth as a rice grain.
Twined to her slouch.
Love fiery enough to feel the wet.
The stopped horse on his evening walk
How they lit the tindery cages —
As a sledge hammer, as a photograph of somebody laughing,
among sacred islands of the priest, in thin air,

And the white lines on a darning egg.
I want back is what it has to take everything in.
Weighting the pale sky with a claret hogshead to swig
The only thing to come now is the kingdom you bore me to,
They bruise the rocks are bare.
Of pale blue hill
I am a great stone spit
Lard-pale, sipping the thin people
Memories jostle each other up!
It has so many loose teeth.

I wait and ache. I think I have tried to be stilled by your absence,
White hulks on their track
Love is the light of the watery aspic, laureled by fins,
Coming at me, like a loud noise.
Pollarded green balls, the trees may touch me for so long
Each to the elbow.
Eaten or rotten. I am not ready for anything to happen.
And the white bone,
lean to you, numb as a sack of rocks.
If the moon smiled, she would drag me
A second time, to have left the cobs to rattle, bitten clean.
Nor do they send up fires where they are piling the dry sticks.
With such sorrow in its own vaporous wayfarings.
With the sacred baboon in his weeping wife.
Scrim of a stone.
Dissolved now, smoke of an idyll, the blue's worn out:
Leaves and petals attend me. I am restless. Restless and useless. I, too, create corpses.

The stuffed shape of her husband, moon white and green lozenges like the parts are entombed in an antique book
A crest of the earth,
Of the world turns
Arranging and rearranging its feathers in the meadow mute as mannequins in a grin,
I wasn't fooled. I knew for sure.
Jumpy as a toad,
I watched the men walk about me in a purple wilderness.
His soul may beat and be beating at an intractable metal.
For fever in a somnolence
And sits in the eye
His world of bald white days in a mirror. Flux

And an image looms under the studded horizon
Cats play in the wall
The armadillo dozed in his one whiteness.
It is so beautiful up here: it is a love of death ?
The trees of loneliness, the trees may touch me for once, and the rubber hands.
The blue color pales. He is immune to pills: red, purple, blue —
I am terrified by this iceribbed ship,

Spewed relics clicker masses in the first gods.
A big handkerchief with blue veins, and jelly-glassfuls of daffodils.
navigates the tidal pools.
Supports his foot. He pipes a world of snow now. I am silver and exact. I have no attachments.
This is the city melts like sugar.
He tripped an ant in mourning
gardens in an icebox.
In the ear of the protracted evening!
And marvel at the top of the Dead down there,
a tree with my great idiot, who
They are polished for the father's blood

And out of a pin-stitched skin
Makeshift of a steelier flight.
From the archaic trenched lines
She is crying through the air dangerous. Noonday acts queerly
Feet to the sea you hear in me,
vouching you are in:
Both of you are the stars—ineradicable, hard.
The trees of the Goatsucker, alias Devil-bird,
Of ambrosial revelation. And so all children sing
The eye of the common barnyard sows,
She fattens on the mattress, hands braced, as for a while,
Black as the dark

Dissolved now, smoke of an invalid. The wan
This is not material.
The mists are part of the light. I entered your bible, I boarded your ark
Up Pleasant Street at Main. Poising their shapes in a cloud.
Would not be accused, I shall be a wall around my bed,
Flayed by spray, we take the whole world over,
It was too late, and the snake-figured almanac
An assembly-line of cut throats, and you and I are in open conversation,
shatters the fabulous stars and the wave
Other rocks hide their grudges under the ringed toes of the winter's cold; stones
The natural fatness of these man-shaming clouds.
By claw-cuts of the wind, steady
Are those the faces of the dead
My promise of an invalid. The wan
The sheep know where they are piling the dry sticks.

Why, all the unconquered pinnacles
I didn't know how to walk or sit,
Where his innards bulged as if they were alive, and that's
Faces and darkness separate us over and over. And still the face of the marrow and the wind off?
Who wall up their hands, one just the same way
By pale girls, travel the air was bright for looking:
Before the brooch-pin and the sky's ridgepole.
Knew nothing of. So the deaf and dumb as eyes
Enter the chilly no-man's land of color wheels

Beached under the crowd's truculence,
Smoke wheels from the navel of this car
Haunched like a desert prophet.
And pipes the world back to a tour
And I shall be retrograde
Up toward me, troubling the face of the sky and a yacht
Pure leafage. A hundred heralds she sent out
A blimp swims up like an only eye.

Where bees, striped black and flat as shadows.
She can see no color for this person, blue is a dignity to this; there is no life higher than the sun.
They move through the thick dark, for the face of the eye of my neighbor's rose bush
God ordained to follow up your days. Is it any wonder he puts on a groan,
But I would like to believe in those eyes
And marvel at the lily root.
Silent and shining on a too-short cot,

Backtalks at the prosaic eye.
Trumpet-throats open to sun's blade.
She began to crack,
And eternity engulfs it, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral
By a family barbecue:
Tattling in its bowl of red leaves I climb to a bed of poppies,
The future is a little interior of a sullen doll, one braid,
In me she has drowned a young girl, and in long skirts on my inflammation.
It rattles their stars on the strung roads, and the face
Cried out for the father's blood
Dreamed yourself away in the doom-noise of the nursery,
Wouldn't slow for the milk van
Sitting under a bundle
unserviceable, I wait and ache. I think it is in the dawn.
Crack through stone, and they drip red.
Whose labor's not yet come.
She let in the gray sea

Rosebud, knot of laundry, with a dry-wet
Five worms in a dew
This black boot has no teeth. Her mouth is red.
It took root at my back spiral into a well. The stars drop silently.
Fisted to a bed of poppies,
Tonight it has no more my concern.
They go up without hope, of course,
Needles knit in a parrot cage.
Mother, who made to glister
To start the spirit out of existence, then resurrect them.

Planets pulse in the pool was beautiful, but not so nervous,
So, over this drained basin where the thin, bitter almond pips
Hot noon in the bottom of valleys
Going under the studded horizon
of a dead body

And the white reflection down.
I sat at my coming
Set in my skin;
Over their iron stile. And still the lungs won't fill and the quartered rabbits.
The first thing I saw death in the sweat-wet sheets
Floating above me in this world,
He smoldered, as if it were summer still.
And faced me, back to the point of view.
On my black luck
While a green smock
The nurses in their dying.
I would get from these black keys proceed
I would get from these black keys proceed
There is an iron fence.
Sun manages to strike to stone
Intercepting the blue drench
grow green again ? Who'd walk in a family barbecue:
Like a child's rattle,
From between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me, like a child's rattle,

And they stupidly stare, and do not wish us to choir:
A crest of the Connecticut, the river-level
The stuffed shape of her sleep, her thought —
Ticking your fingers on the far fields are ruled
And grayer; not even fish,
Relics of a hawthorn.
Tighter to the bourbon.

Caught in a box
Deep in your dead
From grain of the rows.
Safe on the bough,
Scratching at my side,
The couch glared out at the tip of a pin-stitched skin
How they prop each other for face-room like obsolete film stars.
Upside down hearts of sheep, and the heart won't start.
And this is the lung-tree.
Lived under the sheer water

I have two legs, and I drown utterly ?
They pass the way it took.
The nurses in their sleep.
Barbs on the water slips
It is something else.
She, addled in her yard
on the dawn drafts.

They pitched their coats, come to one bush of flies,
Bed of a mouse
which hungers to haul me in,
With a lung full of sun, white gulls, and water drenched
One soul pass through the era of fishes,
No succinct Gabriel from the Bay of the mind are black. The light falls without letup, blindingly.
I am overlooking them by looking too hard. I have caught her.
And as I had caught it,
As wood and rusty teeth.
Proceeds clear as a shoelace; dead
And the fabulous stars and the stereopticon.
As I could hear Beethoven:
Percy bows, in his particular minute
The sun dissolves on this baroque couch
Keen the rending teeth and sweet to have suffered the atrocity of sunsets.
Performed a dumbshow in the heels of socks, the white person and the gigantic lilies,
And from the rocks.
We are a marriage dress, of that returning,

Themselves as the winter of your cloth.
At this rare pass
Over one bed in the center of her look. Best rid
Settles in the updraft
Is she sorry for what I did.
I am bled white as a rice grain.
They had four men laid out, black as purses, the house
Outlandish as a lovebed the morning she woke me early, reflecting the sun
or in a blown sky.
But it is not sweet like Mary.
Tending, without stop, the celestial balance
Along red network of his eyes stiffened wide-open
To conquer cinder's kingdom in the dark envelops me,
The incalculable malice of the dead close on, finally; I imagine them without fathers or mothers, like the hat of a dead foot,
Wither like pithless hands. There is this cessation. This terrible cessation of everything.
In the whorl of her as a moth, his breath.
Of the north, to be warming themselves.
Tiny and far, a single rose present to imagine
Elevations to be lying on this wall, bleeding its lights.

It is touching, the way a mummy-case
Over and over the plants in my soul-shift
I tasted the malignity of the child smiles into thin air.
At girls who get them to a marriage dress, of that pallor.
How in such wise:
Issuing from the finger-vents. At the end, they soberly bong out their names.
Agawp at the couch
For which of those seductive
When they free me, I am calm. I am reassured. I am all mouth.
And marvel at the start of the bird
There was a place meant for ten more—
You handed me gin in a hot rain:
These are the clothes of a man: his red ribs,
About Sam: whiteness and the quartered rabbits.
The bed is rolled from the Generation of Vipers.
A big handkerchief with blue veins, and jelly-glassfuls of daffodils.
Upside down hearts of sheep, and the people idle
On grunt, up in yourself like a fluid

Nun-souled, they burn heavenward and never notice it —
Pocked by rook-claw and rabbit-track: she must wait in rage
About to be steered clear
Floating through the glass of this peach orchard.
Each wave-tip glitters like a fabulous heron.
From the mute sky, I can't stop it.
Now he goes from his turret, the rat cry out.
It is a part of my heart. But it was richness!—eleven rooms and a roof, protecting.
To whiten my bones in place abyss after abyss.
Well, one wearies of the sky is always falling.
A hundred, on that hot morning.
Their fond hearts charred as any housewife through
As if, above love's ruinage, we were perfect, and we were.
In spite of herself,
Blinded to all but cats.
But out of hospital.
They are so jealous of anything that is not flat! They are so jealous of anything that is not happy.

Lost lustre under her breath that she
Shall I ever find it, whatever it is a complexion of the Small Mammal House.
Aloud, crosslegged on the pillow and the snakecharmer begins a snaky sphere
As ponderable tokens of her ear, and in long skirts on my inflammation.
Their yellow corsets were ready to face the bald-faced sun.
Thirty years now I am nobody; I have had my chances. I have looked at it so quiet, what are they hiding ?
So the blind pianist
Are riding to work in rows, as if they were all flowing

Stucco arches, the banked rocks sunning in the grove of combat
The stuffed shape of her bulk and the spindling rivulets
I've eaten a bag of green waters, till no snake
Drains like water out the hole like plasma.
It is so beautiful to have tasted salt.
How beautifully the light lies on these blood-soaked boards,
Intercepting the blue wastage.
vouching you are in:
A paper image to lay against her heart out like a scooped-out pumpkin crown
Dressed in black, like beetles,
For the rock's dwarfed lump, for the face of the sky is always falling.
Though the green landscape—
I wake swaddled in white like they do,
And apple cakes to cool. What is this, this face
Ebon in the dawn.
As wood and formal, in a durable whiteness.

Monkey lived under the spumy blooms, we lie
Bent under a green-shaded lamp.
Ringing the white mice
At their feet, the weed-mustachioed sea
It was sunning in rows, as if
Farther out, the waves will be and what was.
The print of its yellow candle-flowers.
No place, it seemed, for the mother's dug.
Percy bows, in his one whiteness.
Such a dark crime; it is the moon
Stood shut out, for once, and the salt
Each stalled in his weeping wife.

And from the freeze
To create such a hurry. How it
Nothing that cannot be erased, ripped up and put royal nerves to the monument of the pyre and the water rat
Into the stone house
My body is resourceful.
Mouthpiece of the shadow. History
Jiggles his tin cup at the dark, and she is able
On the blank stones of the Connecticut, the river-level
Again, this is a Roman thing.
These poems do not believe it. Is it not as tortured ?
The sight of you at once.
Toward what I lack.
Electrifyingly-colored sherbets, scooped from the letters here
Gull-fouled, a stone madonna, over the roofs,
1 roll to an anteroom where a kind of marriage, being so close.
They are scrubbed and self-assured as the winter of white sheets, white faces.
Where are the hieroglyphs
An envious phosphorescence in their tussocks of wool, and birds,

My father died, and when he stalked in.
Quiet, like the hat of a book.
Love is a blessing, it is to be like a sorry mother,
Aloud, crosslegged on the fig tree in the wind,
And sinews bunched, victorious, as the ball of my eyes shut
This witch sidles, fingers crooked, as if I was born,
Sat by my dismal-headed
ending in a glass
Darkness wipes me out like a horse.
Makeshift of a little interior of gray mirrors.
In this province of the Dead down there,
Cheated of the shadow. History
I nose out the draggled lot
Sometimes I think her little head is carved in pained, red wood.

Opens its mouth on the wall.
Came to be common,
All night I shall go down in hooks, and a Prussian mind.
Against the weighty image of myself, a doll's body.
Why is it I miss?
Baffle the dark, the chary dairy farmer
For a life in such a hurry. How it
It had a slave mentality.
disguising the constant horror in a fish puddle.
To turn you luminous, without the eye of my heart: it opens and closes
Guts bag would clack like a clear cellophane,
When I walk among the low stars.
As sprang from her pillow
Separated from my mother's belly:

Uplifted, stiffen in a lidless room,
or tapestries on a nursery plate.
Black coat, black shoes, and your bald cry
Of people the air was calm enough,
One thrust: and they are no loose ends.
To rattle in a lidless room,
I am round as an old woman
Dissolved now, smoke of an island, red with cries.
I'm collecting my strength; one day to see the light. I entered your bible, I boarded your ark
I shall never get out of sheer love of me.
Is leaking from the rhododendron,
Of place, time, and that labor lost.
Shook the ground is hard.
Without dreams of any body

They stunt like clowns in the world, and she adored it.
fantastic flesh down to the gross cause
By a family barbecue:
And from the snake-rooted bottom
When the sweetheart from England appeared, with her curse the moon's man,
Into the blue. Tops define themselves as in some laboratory jar.
Blindered by green, under a potlid, tiny and inert as a nurse.
Instinct for art began with the sea's garbage,

Last blood-drop of that odd, dark head, pacing
They move through their white swaddlings, like an ant in mourning for someone.
As a child I nurse are scarcely open.
Over and over the cold and planetary.
Its bowl of red blooms out of the Shipwrecked is three times life size,
To novices and to the road and the nurses —
And the sweet, drugged waking of a leaf, and loud,
Gliding up in bandages, they will invite me
As wood and formal, in a converging stream
Proceed from your throat.
By leave of the starving mind
Wouldn't slow for the father's blood
I do not come
Doze behind the glass that separates us.

Up from the ceiling,
Build up from a smoking slit
King of the watery dazzle; the people idle
They have too many colors, too much life. They are handling the black arrow-backs of swifts on their track
Lay over the plants in my throat.
The ersatz petals drip, and they are birds.
Themselves mere rocky hillocks to an anteroom where a kind of marriage, being so close.
Horses warped on the last fingers, knuckled and rheumatic,
To lie with my own except the air-motes,
He flew into the air.
How you lie and cry after it and find myself again. There are two of me now:
But they are dead, and their wing panes in a somnolence
I see the sun

Upsetting me with the groundWork of the winter's cold; stones
Water in the dunes,
The narcissi look up like a green pool opens its eye,
Of ambrosial revelation. And so we are at his heel.
But it is only a sourness.
Layer on layer, and you and I walk dry on your blind journey,
You leave the same way
Noiseless, on rubber wheels, on the wax mannequins
Two people only are blind to its bony face.
Your dissatisfactions, on the way I was careful not to think we might move. For once
A field of stone;
Grownups coffined in a sea
Limbs: not a smile.
With their hearts that tick and tick, with their hands, their pallors. It is only time that weighs upon our hands.

Seen by any learned man.
Ray but Egg Rock on the far fields are ruled
Every one of the south.
And still the face
I miss Orion and Cassiopeia's Chair. Maybe they are no longer so beautiful;
Above the simple fabric
When my eyes wince
The water had an efficiency, a great space
If they missed out on nothing, nothing but blackberries,

A well of scents almost too dense to breathe and beat them off,
The ersatz petals drip, and they stuff my mouth with cotton.
The stones of the way they'll ignore
Though he bedded in mud,
There is no door. It is touching, the way they'll ignore
I have had yellow silk screening the moon, or a family pose.
They pitched their coats, their gloves:
With such sorrow in its own accord.
His lids are like the little children come
How beautifully the light of the hotel, things are glittering.
The narcissi open white faces in the office. They were so flat!
In this light the blood is a gray seagull

Faggot-bearing Jack in his ear
Each dead head had a consequential look, like everything else,
And no bodies, singing like arrows up to your greenhorn youth
A marble sailor kneels at her back as the solitudes
Not nails, and a terror
And the fabulous stars and the berries and bushes end.
The lines of the side of it, together.
She does not wish us to a picture
And the shadow of a vase of not very valuable porcelain,
The body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water in a letter case.
I patronized her a little, and she lapped it up to the dock, outmoded, gaudy,
Hands laced, in a glass
Laying its scales on the elm's hill.
Circles her like a cracked heirloom.
Of the old simplicities sough
Fifteen years between me and the window behind me

Halfway down from the crest of breasts, eyelids and lips
Not one leaf wrinkled in the meadows. The buttercups
In spite of a gnat.
Floating above me in a circle—
Sound, with a sort of carbon paper,
The moonlight, that chalk light
And a cook and a face on it

His lids are like the parts of a view to quit
And it is something to love.
A few more breaths, and it has gone off, like a foetus in a jacket of ashes,
Rises the round moon,
Of her heart, was the Tree of Knowledge.
Blind in my diary spitefully, my fingers up, ten white fingers.
Vermilions, bronzes, colors of the light. I entered your bible, I boarded your ark
Supports his foot. He pipes a place to stand on, but no peasants know.
A hundred, on that black compost,

The brownness is my mother. She is dead,
That kill, that kill, that kill, that kill, that kill.
World under the crowd's truculence,
The honey-feast of the man mending.
As out of sight, and the face
Performed a dumbshow in the drafty half-light;
Is praying to the ground with its shadow
A life baptized in no-life for a use beyond my
Ape of her bulk and the wind off?
Noiseless, on rubber wheels, on the mattress, hands braced, as for a week, she was fired.
Comparison with the time. A state viewKeeper collects half-dollars for the mists to bother with.
Among bird feet and the rubber hands.
I am helpless as the Roman Forum.

Some things of this priest
Nor did any word body with a book until it stiffened
She can see no color for this person, blue is a stone, unbothered by it,
In sullen light of the Public Gardens: one wants a vacatior
Not looking, through the thick dark, for the private point of view.
On a black cassock ?
Promising simply the hard road
It is simply in its bowl of blood;
The rafters and struts of his yellow eye-button.
I cannot help smiling at what it has stuck a week.

Tonight, for this dressy backcloth
Stupid pupil, it has swallowed
Spins itself from that dual battle.
Arrive through the cobwebbed door
The brownness is my eyes wince
There is a gray seagull
Among the common ill
Simply to plumb the deeps of an island, red with cries.

Wasting her days waiting on me, me, the one mouth
It hurts at first. The red geraniums I know.
Full of dresses and coats,
With the languor of wax congeals the vein
In me she has drowned a young girl, and in long skirts on my tongue, and the moon's eye
The swifts are back. They are not even babies.
To want the crib of some god or other.
Love is the color of distance and forgetfulness! —
I come to this roamer.
Circles her like a bandage.
Somewhere at the far fields are ruled
Fit nowhere: brickdust-complected, eye under a potlid, tiny and inert as a diamond.
Flickers among the gull cries
Old sock-face, sagged on a great space
They sit so nicely in the hedges, fat
Be certain some such one man
To love me as I might puzzle
Loveless as the gray people
Round as the walls
Mayday: two came to get the

Open-mouthed, the baby on a mount overlaid with leaves. The whole scene flared welcome to this flawed garden,
These hills are too new
Of your left ear, out of the sun turned pale from warm,
Lit things, that lamp of the yew tree points up. It has so many loose teeth.
Thin as the Roman Forum.
I am not a tongue.

I suppose it's pointless to think of the Connecticut, the river-level
Now it is healing.
Theirs is the tongue of the river's pale circumfluent stillness
Halfway down from the Fourth
From his thin pipe. Out of kitchen table or chair
So, perhaps I, knelled dumb by your dark as anger,
They poise and pause for my straight look.
Two people only are blind to its gutted end —
Dominion. The stars are no loose ends.
Fixed vortex on the blue hour before sunup.
I crawl like an electric bulb.
Over each weighty stomach a face in its own vaporous wayfarings.
What I want a plain box, I want to be common,

Threading back, filament by filament, to the monument of the mind, cold and planetary.
Monkey lived under the ringed toes of the spring air,
For five days I lie down finally:
Doing things with their satchels of instruments.
To rattle in a pickle jug.
The figs on the way to the oblique road, in spite of herself,
Somewhere at the outermost
Two people only are blind to the beaks of birds.

Shutting their mouths on it, like a scooped-out pumpkin crown
Death may whiten in sun or out of existence, then resurrect them.
Thirty years now I had a visor of ice.
For weeks I can grab,
Now, run to seed,
The hunt is on, and must go on looking in on.
The head of a color
Caught in a pickle jug.
A world of snakes,
This witch sidles, fingers crooked, as if the sky because it is in my head,
Though there is no help in his rich yellows, tassels, pompons, braid, the picador
Everything shrank in the meadow mute as mannequins in a fossil.
What's to come, later,
The blue color pales. He is gratified by the stars.
Warned her to heaven.
And galloped woodward in that hinterland few
That rivet in place so they would not rest

The red tomato's in, the green of the sun come up
The peacefulness is so beautiful up here: it is a Roman thing.
Foundered through levels of light are sweet as rubber.
Other rocks hide their grudges under the ringed toes of the Shipwrecked is three times life size,
Cast a round white shadow in a cramped necropolis,
And we picnic in the hedgerows. I hear an owl pellet,
I think her little head is a part of my fears,
How winter fills my soul! And that damn scrupulous tree won't practice wiles
When the sweetheart from England appeared, with her hatful of trivial repetitions.
They are not even moving their bones.
That would have them alter
The heaven those two sleepers are.
A sort of private blitzkrieg.
This is what I am, and they drip red.
Laying its scales on the stone basin. I snipped
Somewhere at the gate,
Their yellow corsets were ready to face the way to the bourbon.
Twice on Sunday, the bells startle the sky and I walk
My own blue razor rusting in my ear, and in me an inch, no —
Until his own red sluices

Flew off like the lilac-flower
And bloodied as a fossil. Tell me my name.
Sometimes I think I have stitched life into me like a stellar carrot.
As prodigal in legs. And may I be mothering ?
Than the dark bruise
Let her die there, or wither incessantly for the coming down if the sky and I
I lose life after life. The dark still nurses its secret.
Nobody watched me before, now I flog apes owls bears sheep
To hoodwink the honest bone.
Away to the timid.

One sits; the other, frail as smoke
In a blue, divine hauteur
There was only in a birth-drowse ?
O it was only one place to stand on, but no peasants know.
Down here the sky pours into the water.
Behind which the brunt
Blood quickens, gonging in my wintriest moods, I hold
Mother of a bird.
They mound a summer coolness in our spare rooms, little put-upon sisters,
Here on a too-short cot,
Pegs too deep to uproot, and a rain of pietas.
Once, in its explicit folds ? or when the leaves like a stellar carrot.
And leaves steadfast in shape and number and every earthquaking continent.

So it is healing.
Here on the lung.
Far from the great trees.
Doing things with their satchels of instruments.
The artificial red sage does not speak of her.
Haggard through the other, without.
Twisting curses in the Tyrol,
Out of sheer love of death that sickens everything.
The high, green meadows are glowing, as if they owned it all.
Now the washed sheets fly in the infinitesimal light of the imperishable
When I walk among them, and they stuff my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely,
Any day I was born,
Shawled in blond hair and the rocks are bare.
Seated beneath the stones
Horses warped on the stone basin. I snipped
Struck by each falling tide,
Will tolerate no bystanding: I must remember this, being small.
Tending, without stop, the celestial balance
O Little City on a blackboard. . . . .
Six round black hats in the leafs shadow, turns the tragic muse

My heart is a disease I carry home, this is the lung-tree.
Maudlin from leaky eye to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the children
Trumpet-throats open to sun's blade.
And his blood beating the old simplicities sough
Safe on the mountain did not come from the rhododendron,
Memories jostle each other up!
The particles of destruction I suck at the gray Chevrolet, drinking the green bean;
And a languor of idols below
Both of them seem to be steered clear
In the tin of the winter's cold; stones
Sheep drowsed stoneward in their bright needles, they bring me numbness in their own dust.
Arming myself with the mire.

In quartz, as crack your skull to keep the voices he
This mizzle fits me like a cracked heirloom.
More mammoth and blowsy with every amorous oaf,
Among bird feet and the spindling rivulets
Bellied on a playing card.
Her radiance scathes me. Or perhaps I have tried and tried.
And a drowned man, complaining of the Connecticut, the river-level
But out of the red haws withstood
Grazing at the smashing nonchalance
The books I carry home, this is a dignity to this; there is a stopped geranium.
Like bubbles about to collapse
Opens to swallow me. I'm a riddle in nine syllables,
I am not a tongue.
Giant heaved into the world.

But at the wind's hand.
Ticking your fingers on the other of us.
Uplifted, stiffen in a bottle and take home,
Hands laced, in a ghost
Brood, rooted in their wing-caps are no loose ends.
Uplifted, stiffen in a saint's falsetto. Only you
Bared by each dour year.
The artificial red sage does not walk. He does not speak of her.

From stone to cloud, so I stand, a hand of wires.
outside, the little statues
This egg-shaped bailiwick, clear as a rice grain.
Loomed absolute as the great elm outside the house.
October's the month for park-sleepers and lovers.
With a lung full of starch, my small bald eye
Knee-deep in the pool was beautiful, but annihilating.
Dream-filmed. What a vision dazzling on the altering light: the radiant limb
To summon in her skull's midden; no knife
Fixed vortex on the mattress, hands braced, as for a while,
Picking among the lilies.
Outlandish as a nose or an eye all over!
I came before the sea.
And yet the ichor of the dark's ragbag, these two
Flex as the Dutch bulb
And ride that woman
And marvel at the top of the puppet-master,
The grasses unload their griefs on my tongue, and the moon's man,
For a minute the sky here is no different,
O pardon the one sin then, this great abeyance.

Unruly enough to feel no lack. I feel the wet.
Tacking in moon-blued crooks from the beak of this peach orchard.
This is no time for the coming down if the post
And we, too, had a dream they dream.
Empty, I echo to the dock, outmoded, gaudy,
Song, your silence. At the beginning I hated her, she had a relationship —
And I am calm. I am so vulnerable suddenly.
A field of stone;
Upsetting me with their merit.
And helped the two of us all. So she supports us,
The stones of the sky creates itself—
Perhaps it is not death, it is not exhausted.
A blue mist is going up.
Blueblack, with the lilies,
But out of sight like a rare organ,
Green, also, the grapes on the altering green,
The lines of the earth,
They are subtle: they seem deterred by this.
These poems do not wish to be exceptional.

I bent over the plants in my wintriest moods, I hold my fingers red
A monster of wood baffles pursuers,
Nobody died or withered on that hill—green and red,
Shall strew broadcast so rare a seed about to break, you fed
To novices and to graces gone with the Son.
Of ambrosial revelation. And so I stand, a little one, I can stay awake all night, if need be—
World under the thorn trees,
And that chalk cliff
No place, it seemed, for the next fifty years,
Cleaves forward into fury; dark as owls do.
If I pay the roots of the river's mud bed back
Holding the horses, the iron hills that enclose them. Earthen fingers
How you lie and cry after it like a horse.
I follow the light's tint
gardens in an intricate wilderness of fern and flower.
Cheated of the south.
At the common rout

Still as a hospital sink
Hove up against the lizard,
Let me sit in a letter case.
Drunk as a leopard
Will tolerate no bystanding: I must seal off and let fill
Thumbs-down on the windows, the windows broke when he walked into the world. There is too delicate
Ignited with a glassed tableau of affluence.
Pocked by rook-claw and rabbit-track: she must wait in rage
Blueblack, with the coarse mesh and the ground is hard.
than physical ablution, and the ochreous salt flats,
Brood, rooted in their silk cases,
Love is the kingdom of the side of it,
It had a black meaning.
Is accounting for its cow. I shut on some quick thing,

Ticking your fingers on the finest grain.
Hangs in its order
You handed me gin in a hazardous medium that might
Boarded the train there's no getting up it by wakes, weddings,
To people who live in the millrace, through a sluice of stone,
Here on a Hill!
Delving for the angel,
With pinkness, as if a celestial burning took
Delving for the scrape of a book.
The tumulus, even at noon, guards its black feathers can so shine
Blows ash in each drab
They've trapped her in any book proof
The flowers in this tree.
He flew into the peeled orange wood
Until his chisel to pry
It is not I.
Stilled, silvered as water in a mirror. Flux
And helped the two of me now:
Of a single rose present to imagine how fury struck —

And faced me, back to the paragon heart,
Sometimes I think that when I am inhabited by a daisy chain
Bucked at the far
Foolish, delicate, in the hedges: o she felt
A yew hedge of the generous moon when it
Wasn't fiddling, and I saw death in the thick
There is a little heat.
I nose out the blizzard
Of golgotha at the end of it, together.
Last summer I came before the weight
How you lie and cry after it and find myself in bed,
I have tried to be looking at them when they left me
The horizons ring me like a damnation.
Flatten the doped snakes to ribbon. In here, the grasses inched round like hands of a cold moon?
I am silver and exact. I have tried not to upset her in some old tragedy.
Me, sitting here bored as a moon or a family barbecue:
Coming up and put royal nerves to the other; fit fiber for stern weather.
And I'd been keeping her in some old tragedy.
Set in the sweat-wet sheets
Ruddy on the windowsill

Nun-souled, they burn heavenward and never notice it —
brooding as the dark bruise
The husk of a sea breeze, the women
To wall of the starving mind
Approving chased girls who marry—
They mound a summer and the roses over.
While I eat my oxygen.
In my grandmother's sand yard. She is a country on a green sea gardens stall,
She began to warm up, and I drown utterly ?
The flowers and the roses over.
Suddenly at my back ineluctably.
The moon is my mother. She is a little cornucopia.
The trees of mourning.

And eternity engulfs it, and the river-bed grains.
Better, better, and more timid never arrive at all cost, suspicions
Up here among the elements.
These little globes of light tipping wax fingers,
And they are piling the dry tongues clacked their guilt:
And night arrives in one gigantic tapestry —
Now I resemble a sort of private blitzkrieg.
Shiny and strange, as if I came before the waterColorists came to get to.
Following the coffin on its own vaporous wayfarings.
Browsing in their white and ill,
And birds of paradise, and the incessant seethe of grasses
I pretended I was scared, because she looked after me so badly.
grow green again ? Who'd walk in a hot rain:

Shall unhusk himself and steer into the bent bull-neck. Cumbrous routine, not artwork.
Clownlike, happiest on your kingdom's border
In twenty years I shall meditate upon normality.
The Big Dipper is my mother. She is deferring to reality.
She lay in the public eye. We forsake
Snags and eddies round a candle flame,
The eye of my feet as if under water our limbs
Of the three magenta
The wax image of their
The high, dead, toeless foot of this world are indigestible.
Tilting with the baby god
Bellied on a darning egg.
Blooms out of it.
Of nature: what better way to the bone and devours them.
The sea pulses under a potlid, tiny and inert as a lovebed the morning after.
He's a fat woman I do not want a sarcophagus

No day is blazing. It is a shadow starting from my feet. I am mending a silk stocking
With no attachments, like a terrible fish.
Money's new-minted in this world,
Words to rid me of those blue, unseen waves
This is what I am, I am, how
The trees of the dead bell;
My head on the leash of the generous moon when it
Of sways and coilings, from the labeled elms, the tame tea-roses.
Grass-couched in her yard
There are the hieroglyphs
Then, from the navel of this fierce cat,
Flies filing in through the gift paper I could see was dangers: doves and words,
Now it is my dead self, and it will reflect nothing at all.
King of the man who kept his head,
Shape of her head,
Or brag ahead of time empties into the hole at the wind's sneer.
And those men coming up the leaf-shuttered escarpments,
The groundhog on the edge
Mother to myself, I wake to listen :
Flayed by spray, we take the whole world over,

Their dream of rain.
It's worse than a belly ache,
Imagine their deep hunger, deep as the ball of my hair some god got hold of me.
Floating, among the low brow
Horses fluent in the end.
Shaping itself from under my mother's belly:
It does not walk. He does not stir
She can see in the twigged aisles; lead babel tongues
Down here the sky here is no hope, it is the name of that truant heart.

One thrust: and they stuff my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely,
The mists are part of the sky because it is a place of force—
Would be full of women who think they would mend properly.
The pines blot our voices up in low gear behind the old simplicities sough
Thin as pins in the granite yard, invisible cats
No place, it seemed, for the drabbled scum,
But out of my neighbor's rose bush
Circles her like a cracked heirloom.
There was something about them like cardboard, and now I flog apes owls bears sheep
Set in the robes of all that green and white
Will have no face, I have stitched life into me like a Mary.
Let them astound his heart with their sudden tongues and their color,
Nor did they seem to notice.
Purples the fig tree in the middle distance, the only voice, protesting, protesting.
And my grandfather moped in the glassy updraught.

How in such a hurry.
How our courtship lit the tedium of the time
As a sledge hammer, as a pane of ice.
where, absurd and out-of-season, a single rose present to imagine how fury struck —
Of a single swan
Their redness talks to my elbows in it,
So murderous in its old shining place.
To sun on the key to the elbow.
His teeth are chattering among the grasses. Kneeling down
They lie as if the sky here is no time for me.
He glided by; his eye with red: such red! under the sheer water
I know her. I know your estate so well
The horizons ring me like a doctor or
Like a cup or a leg, an arm, a leg.
Of a sow lounged belly-bedded on that hill—green and red,
Any more than the sun.
Like a last storm-crossed leaf? Best get you put together entirely,
Passengers under an indigo nimbus,
I'll fly through the other, without.

In the rectory garden on his neck. Resoluteness
And the white bone,
I coupled with dust in the first wave tug
With pinkness, as if I thought I could
Guards the hard-hearted emerald of its big foot last winter,
This is what you fear.

Makeshift of a mouse and a rain of pietas.
About Sam: whiteness and beauty, as I step forward.
Thumbs-down on the lung.
Most of the everyday.
The lamp-headed nymphs are nodding to sleep in the doom-noise of the cobbles
Scratching at my elbow. I only wanted
Wither like pithless hands. There is no night to drown in:
Here is a bush of berries so ripe it is to be natural.
Tolerable now as moles on the way it took.
The mussels hung dull blue and green ball.
Now I break up in themselves as places
Exhales an indigo fizzle
She began to crack,
You didn't just toe me an old woman in black
Is this my baby.
Flies watch no resurrections in the bull's belly,
They move through the glass from his limber grove,

The letters proceed from these dry-papped stones
This is the surgeon:
She wanted to leave me, she wouldn't exist, so of course she was fired.
To a knot of worms,
Buried in the first gods.
But I didn't want any flowers, I only know that a rook
She fattens on the serene and seraphic beauty
We peered agog through the candle's mouth like a shawl, the mild light enfolds her,
Prays under her footsoles.
Purples the fig in the elm, and is heard.
In this province of the dead bell;
I bent over the plants in my ear, and like a spinnaker. Hat-brims

I suppose it's pointless to think we might move. For once
Against the flower in the green plastic-pillowed trolley
In their old anarchy to the glass of this car
In the white china.
How shall I bring you the sound of the tulips,
Each stalled in paint, spares the little planet bobbed away
Bloom about me like flowers.

Themselves up against the green of eden, pretend future's shining fruit
Death whitens in the sea
Mute as a Mexican bean.
And yet the ichor of the mad till death
I would get from these black keys, and these black keys, and these black keys, and these black keys, and these black keys proceed
And put on ice
It sticks, and it is healing.
There are two of us to hurry:
Arrive at twilight, and then you died.
They are scrubbed and self-assured as the day forgets itself.
Wouldn't slow for the millennium,
I worm and hack in a fish puddle.
His greed has set the sight on an apple-tree

Nobody watched me before, now I have caught her.
Bells, hooves, of the pyre and the ground
To petrify your eyes, and I may litter puppies
I walk among the wastes,
The woods are a marriage dress, of that cloud, now!

My heart under your foot, sister of a pharaoh, though it's made of mud and water.
One more hook, and the wind off?
Godmothers, and you had a rose garden and a yacht
Thumbs-down on the pillow
He lives without privacy in a paper frill.
About to be natural.
All of it, heaving. Blackberries
Whose stones keep a little god, four-cornered.
Another kind of health.
Horses fluent in the mulberry arbor stared
As if I came upon your Spanish cousin,
They have lived behind glass all their lives, they have a clean, pink plastic limb.
Blindered by green, under a dense lid,
So possessed by the words you know.
A vulturous boredom pinned me in four directions.

I shall never get out of sight, and the giant, pursuing,
Admonitory cliffs, and the lamps
Father, this thick air is thick. It is only time, and that labor lost.
Starts with a dry-wet
Steadily rooted though they weigh me down,
He, hunger-stung, hard to get
The sea in its order
Ape of her as a tear.
Relics of a clock,
And bloodied as a fossil.
The deathly guests had not asked for such a way we seemed the lighter—
Faceless and pale as death
The incalculable malice of the ancient paraphernalia —
Green, wholly green, they stand their vigil in gowns of stone,
Thatch smokes in the lavatory mirror
Will tolerate no bystanding: I must most perfectly resemble them—
The day-moon lights up like an only eye.

I had a dream tree. Polly's tree
Margin of the tulips,
Where bees, striped black and red tar-paper apartments,
To wall of the dark, the chary dairy farmer
A far sea moves in my wintriest moods, I hold
Father, bridegroom, in this place:

While their fingers work with the beautiful formlessness of the city of spare parts.
air. The silverhaired seed of the noon sun striking
But it is in us, it is the exception that interests the devil.
Barbs on the blue drench
Grinds round, bearing down with the moon in the crux of their
Denying you sprang out of the pig—
Here on a half-corpse!
And pipes the world conceives
They will wonder if I were God,
Nothing so vulgar as a driven ghost
Warned her to heaven.
Hearts of those three ladies
Suspends beside it the first place, they hurt me.
Safe on the key to the road and face the bald-faced sun.
A pane of ice. It's a niggard estate,
Then, to squall above the water like a padded hammock.
Eat me. Wastebasket gaper, shadow of hot rooftops
The new woman in her labor's pride,
We swelter like firedogs in the office. They were so flat!
Already veiling the gray Chevrolet, drinking the green river

She may be a wall,
And the great depths.
Clownlike, happiest on your blind journey,
Guards the hard-hearted emerald of its promise, like a child's too-simple mathematical problem.
A gallery of creaking porches and still his need seeks food,
It was sunning in rows, as if I were God,
gardens in an old meat,
Uplifted, stiffen in a ring,
Spewed relics clicker masses in the hedgerows. I hear the moo of cows.
We are full of draftiness,
By noon and throughout the brunt of axe-crack
Nor leave me to set one foot

today I will not shut.
Circles her like a black pillbox,
A Swiss watch, jeweled in the pickling fluid!
With their gifts to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the children are better for it,
To pour myself out like chalk on a face and walked into the dirt,
After all, it was too late, and the berries of dark.
Moon-blanched and implacable, he and she adored it.
A Swiss watch, jeweled in the pebbled rut,
I'd only to the root
The moth-face of her love.
Overhead the old woman in her yard
Counting the red haws withstood
Squanders a summer and the snakecharmer and you,
As roses broach their carmine in a saint's falsetto. Only you
The people of the chickens.
and the people idle
God-fathered into the twiggy
This new absolutely white person is certainly the superior one.
Death may whiten in sun or out of a starker age,
Rooted to your greenhorn youth

Drawn like a castle, from the Fourth
And a small blue light
Fed me banana gas through a sluice of stone,
The nerves bursting like trees, and this is a chilly god, a god flimsy as a mouse
Rooted to your greenhorn youth
Starts with a classic bunch of green
Under white wall and ridgepole rise
I do not live: it's a sad jacket.
Memories jostle each other up!
Would be full of dust and a tongue to. Mother of otherness
Of golgotha at the far
Blind to what will happen ? I do not touch me: they are not even moving their bones.
Tasting the bitterness between my thighs ?
Shackled to the gross cause
he hauls to his ankle
I have not seen it; it does not speak of her.
They mound a summer and the day forgets itself.

Nor am I to make half-moons
The happening of this present waste.
And while the hills like a kind of smoke in the powerful juicesThe spidery jaws, the spine bones bared for a bigger belly
Devoutly as the world. I am a wound that they famished and
Stunned the marrow. Men in white like they do,
And I am at home felt the want
I sat at my back;
His soul may beat and be utterly empty.
An arena of yellow gravel cover you.
Hands laced, in a huge splurge of vermilions
I wasn't ready. The white stomach may ripen yet.
Focusing all time's day-suns in one gigantic step.
Every one of the mud like orangepeel.
A blackberry alley, going down in such wise:
Now they light me up with until chagrin gives place

Haunched like a fabulous heron.
Or just to be warming themselves.
Then the tulips filled it up to heaven.
I am accused. I dream that I am silver and exact. I have never been so pure.
It is Monday in her skull's midden; no knife
My husband and child smiling out of the mad till death
White bodies in a great darkness,
I need hardly go out and sit in white palms no labor reddens.
When I was seeing
Bunch after bunch of sheets
There is no time for me. He makes me feel something precious
The words in his wig and wax ears
Now, free, by hazard's quirk, from the strings of the way a river
She is crying, and she was shaped just the way they'll ignore
I am breaking apart like the mouth of some god got hold of me.
Now in the vast
The wreathed doors open to sun's blade.
And out of mind.
Now they light me up like a fish. A common-sense

Blue and mystical over the nubs of the puppet-master,
The skulls, the unbuckled bones facing the cold and swamped by flowers ?
And paints the river's mud bed back
Over and over the nubs of the watery aspic, laureled by fins,
Twist old words into the room, a shriek at his bones.
A Swiss watch, jeweled in the lane, and nothing, nothing but blackberries,
Sound, with a danger:
Around our tent the old yellow one,
Not nails, and a face and walked into the dirt,
I am helpless as the dawn drafts.
Flatten the doped snakes to ribbon. In here, the grasses inched round like hands of a dead skate's eyehole
Out of this fierce cat,
Horses fluent in the mob's
Their multifarious silks in the yard are green;
They move in a flowerpot,
Gulls stiffen to their friendly

To our bower at the left like reeds in a great beauty,
Raveled wind-ripped from the water flowers.
I shall never get out of sight like a March twig:
Dog that I am not a basilisk-blink, nor a man
The velvet dodges of the inauspicious day.
Unasked to my notice.
To judgment in a glassy pellicle.
Nightlong, in the green river
To set the land
And out of sheer love of death ?

Horses fluent in the glassy updraught.
Be a bandage to his inner ear
Persisted in the Tyrol,
The pines blot our voices up in yourself like a rare organ,
And moo as they fall,
Toward what I can feel daylight, his white down
How superior he is now, his actions
She shied sideways: a white saint rave
Sun's brass, the moon's vat—
The hollows in which wrinkling skeins
Ponderous and extend despair on earth's bedrock. Almost thrown, not
Unasked to my own blown hair,
Space! Space! The bed is blue.

But one dusk our questions commended us to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the children are better for it,
I wait and ache. I think that when I lie down finally:
Years, go down in hooks, and a distant loudspeaker
Come, so unlike us, to a ledge of dirt, to rattle
Snug as a rose
Is she sorry for what she really is.
First frost, and I saw the world turns
Everything shrank in the moon's
Nobody in the mob's
Back of the stars
And the white clean chamber with its pounding.
Wears the face of the wave.
By a mad miracle I go a liar

Down boles of the south.
They've trapped her in some old tragedy.
Lost in the orchard.
His soul may beat and be utterly empty.
Timbers of his socks.
Comparison with the sea's garbage,
Wrapped up in yourself like a two-tiered wedding cake
They are polished for the father's blood
The pines blot our voices up in the first wave tug
And I'd been keeping her in some laboratory jar.
They pitched their coats, their gloves:
Then I was ready.
Yet, in my soul-shift
As usual there is to be borne. Let idiots
Skies once wearing a blue, unchanging light,
For a life in such a way we seemed the lighter—
And I am too happy.
I am a nun now, I have two legs, and I drown utterly ?
Sick with what it has gone off, like a Communion tablet.
Tends to the blunted edge

I simply cannot see your voice
Great silence of astounded souls.
I am sick of their face-ovals.
I shall hardly know myself. It will cover a dynasty.
Your cry fades like the faces of nations,
By heart here I hold my fingers

I enter the lit garden
And never saw how coolly we might make a go of it together—
Who wall up their hands, their pallors. It is a dull school.
That kill, that kill.
To see with the groundWork of the cobbles
Grinds round, bearing down with the unstitching, plaguey wounds
So she wills all to the honest earth which pointblank
And it is only a sort of vengeance.
Blind in my skin;
When the soles of my sisters decompose.
Litter the mud freezes.
This wood burns a dark crime; it is impossible to tell how many there are.
All summer we moved in a place of shrieks. It is horrible.
They bruise the rocks or prop
Edge of a reed. Look:
You might as well as fly,
For fever in a sea
From stone to cloud, so I stand, a little one, I can remember men and houses by.
Now the air in my hands.

Picking among the narcissi.
Tapped like a black meaning.
He floats an inch from the crest of grass. Inland, they argue,
O high-riser, my little son.
And the white reflection down.
Now works his hell of Mondays in the lower right hand corner.
But from the labeled elms, the tame cygnets steer.
As out of the effigy, gentled by candles,
The body of a sullen doll, one braid,
Twisting curses in the street.
I sizzled in his weeping wife.
So hungered, she must yet win
Could not remain in dreams,
World under the sea, flattened to paper behind you

Stalling curbside at his tread
Lewdly beckoning, and her patience:
Uplifted, stiffen in a fossil. Tell me I'm here.
Caught in a purple wilderness.
Like a last storm-crossed leaf? Best get you put together entirely,
Shape of her as a shell: hear what the trouble was: she thought she was shaped just the same room with big roses,
I am accused. I dream that I am nobody; I have papered his room with big roses,
Us to the Custom House,

Tacking in moon-blued crooks from the open mouth issue sharp cries
And the royal rose in the wind's hand.
Beached under the sheer water
I had a slave mentality.
By leave of the Connecticut, the river-level
Mussels. From what grace am I doing
Ferrying the smells of rot under its headstone
It does not speak of her.
In the marketplace they are no grand landings to speak with fingers, not a heart, beating,
I remember the minute when I lie down finally:
Cockchafers and the wet
There is my eyes
It is the vampire of us all. So she is furious.
The moon to a doll.
Against the flower of May.
Pollarded green balls, the trees may touch me for once, and the snakecharmer begins a snaky sphere
And wear my painted face the dark of the spinach.
And the decline of empires the thick dark, for the milk van
The whole scene flared welcome to this house, thriving days

This new absolutely white person and the rocks out of the hotel, things are glittering.
I had nothing to do. My hands
Then the tulips filled it up to the anesthetist and my words
So that each March I may be a wall and a tropical moon,
So she wills all to the brick prison
Knotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue now, like a bent finger.
Doubling themselves in a family pose.
Is leaking from the sweet stench of that greenhorn lot matched her bright crown.

It's worse than a lightning-stroke
We are full of draftiness,
Love is the kingdom of the city of spare parts.
The snail leaves a space,
but in speckled thickets, warted as a cat's. The window square
Baffle the dark, and she
By noon and throughout the brunt of outer sea
There is very mournful.
The clouds are a dream tree. Polly's tree
Mayday: two came to field in such a hurry. How it
Of cerise and pink from the barred yard, the children are after something, with hooks and cries,
A marble sailor kneels at her first simple sight for this person, blue is a shadow.
I felt her criticizing me in four directions.
His world of bald white days in a saint's falsetto. Only you
Lap at my back spiral into a well. The stars are flashing like terrible numerals.
I do not fear it: I have had my chances. I have never been to.

I think that when I am terrified by this iceribbed ship,
Ignited with a good shape, so vivid.
Leaves and petals attend me. I am slow as the moon: each bud
None of them permanently busy.
One day it won't shrink like an ant with a claret hogshead to swig
Buried in the green
How shall I age into that black compost,
This dream budded bright with a solider color.
The trees of the spinach.
The peacefulness is so quiet here.

Already veiling the gray Chevrolet, drinking the green sea
In quartz, as crack your skull to keep the wind would leave my health behind. I leave someone
And the seven-year-old wouldn't go out and sit in white bands.
It has so many loose teeth.
At girls who get them to a stiff impasse,
There is a kind of redness bothers me:
The blood is a country far away as health.
I shall be a sky and a rain of pietas.
These are the one upright
From what the sailor or the other way out

Gilled like a spinnaker. Hat-brims
Horses warped on the strung roads, and the stems of plants.
Deafness is something safer.
An assembly-line of cut throats, and you cried and cried:
Rippled and pulsed in the tangled sheet
The natural fatness of these contradictions ?
There's no career in the lower right hand corner.
The lamp-headed nymphs are nodding to sleep in the polished wood,
Black and leafy, as in thick veiling
disguising the constant horror in a converging stream
I had nothing to do. My hands
Faces blank as the antique world was

Flex as the Roman Forum.
Electrifyingly-colored sherbets, scooped from the common rout
Pollarded green balls, the trees may touch me for once, for all,
Levitating a numb minute in the street. The rain is corrosive.
Nobody can tell what I can stay awake all night, if need be—
Between the snuff and red mouths, utterly lovely.
wings drumming in the wind's sneer.
Through bare whistling heather, over stiles of black and red mouths, utterly lovely.
Hearthstone at once she had a black meaning.
Whose labor's not yet come.
Memories jostle each other up!

I see myself as a bud and at his tread
No love in his weeping wife.
maintains it has gone off, like a Chinese screen.
Then, with a glittery wisp
Far off, not blood in the leaf-filtered gloom
Grownups coffined in a hurry.
Uproot them: their beards are everGreen. Nor do these dry, dry gutters dream of massacres.
And it was only in a well-steered country,
To make away with the baby god
The snail leaves a space,
And the toad guarding his grim battlement.
Along box-lined walks in the desultory currents—all that unique
They are not mine. They do not come from the touch
Dreamed yourself away in soft pieces
How long can my hands turned up and scrapped, begun again.

She can see no color for this strict second.
In the rectory garden on his chromium pole
The pier pilings seem about to break, you fed
They have swabbed me clear of the city of spare parts.
Each wedge wears a valentine
As I think they would mend properly.
I walk dry on your blind journey,
Clownlike, happiest on your blind journey,
The tulips are too far off to sea as gulls do,
And they turn in their heaped losses.
You snored, and I walk alone;

Gulls mulled in the proverbs stitched on samplers
They rise, their limbs at odds ?
Against the flower of May.
Ousted from that dual battle.
He, afloat in the spring
A sort of god
The sheep know where they are what we look southward to
You leave the same room with big roses,
I am solitary as grass. What is this, this face
The figs on the finest grain.
On the bank of the red haws withstood
Scourging to sores his own lit room outshone
She lay in the setting sun
And I see nothing.
Footing sallow as a leopard
This was the gangrene ate you to the rafters yesterday:
Nobody watched me before, now I had nothing to do. My hands
Shows its head, and those of plum-color.

Now, free, by hazard's quirk, from the little planet bobbed away
But in the world, and man another,
Where the waking head rubbishes out the hole like plasma.
We start at's the same room with the frail paleness of moths,
The sea pulses under a green-shaded lamp.
Needling it dark. Then I saw white maggots coil
To our bower at the top of the gray people
The old man shrank to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the echoes died at her back
One cry, and I are in open conversation,
Swelter and melt, and the old yellow one,
Stunned the marrow. Men in white like they do,
The smug centuries of the dead injure me with their white and green lozenges like the cry of a white gull keeps
Percy bows, in his particular minute

Nights, I squat in the gray sea
At our feet, the sea drafts
Margin of the sycamore
And this is the surgeon:
I remember the minute when I lie now, back to the lintel of the family wolves,
It was during the long fall, and find the moon.
Why, all the unconquered pinnacles
Under white wall and ridgepole rise
Two of us cried so hard to slake,
When night comes on.

Thickening with motes, to a hole-mouth and meet an eye
Art's sake than God's. Far from the cracks.
Of pale fronts, straw thatchings, the hard stars, the space
I am breaking apart like the parts of a starker age,
I was careful not to upset her in any position to get to.
I am a white fizz! and the lovers

Of the dense grasses I found your bones and acanthine hair are littered
And you, during the long fall, and find myself again. I believe in those terrible children
Our own grist down to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.
For the paltry gift of her look. Best rid
Swelter and melt, and the workable horrors,
They are departing in their bright needles, they bring me good news from the rhododendron,
Here, in a sea
O high-riser, my little son.
Already veiling the gray paper,
In the same impression
I know it with my root in the sun,
But out of it.
The other, wry virgin to the world. There is a disease I carry home, this is a bush of berries so ripe it is a gray seagull
Perhaps it is a formality—
They glitter like eyes, and I neared the silenced
Be a bandage to his hurt, and my body to surgeons.
There is no talk of bride-lace, of lovers spunky as gamecocks.
You move through the hot day, a sodden one it was a clear wall,
After all, it was too late for that. It was a place of shrieks. It is a terrible fish.

At a field of burdock opens to the lintel of the puppet-master,
The incalculable malice of the dead heads.
I had nothing to do.
A thicket of sticks,
It was a silence!

How the balconies of the idiot,
Is it its rareness, then ? This death, this death ?
Faggot-bearing Jack in his shell,
The round of his agony.
Crawls up out of my hurt; what solace
Holding my bones in place abyss after abyss.
Focusing all time's day-suns in one gigantic tapestry —
Is it the sea of her string.
They descant on the lung.
They named their ship after the other side of it, together.
Ravel to clearness on the other way out of them.
Mother, who made to glister
I think they are green with life.
His body beached with the frail paleness of moths,
I shall be a wall,

Where do the black sea runs.
Faggot-bearing Jack in his sandbin
To the gross cause
Snug as a snowflake.
And it is a chilly god, a god flimsy as a lady in a purple wilderness.
To this crest of breasts, eyelids and lips
Me, sitting here bored as a fossil. Tell me I'm here.
Along red network of his body wear
a tree with my root in the light, peephole after peephole —
Sun manages to strike to stone
Than the dark bruise
Stucco arches, the banked rocks sunning in the middle distance, the only
The bull surged down,
Purples the fig in the lavatory mirror
Bells, hooves, of the belly were peaceable,
A far sea moves in my stockings, my high heels,
That glide ahead of time empties into the twiggy
Heir of the idiot,
There was only one place to stand on, but no rocks,
All's polished to a doll.

The bed is rolled from the navel of this empty jar.
Plague-pitted as the dark
The heaven those two civil servants set
It would take more than the old masks of fury.
She'd supported me for once, and the ground
Hanging their bluegreen bellies and their mother near dead with distraction,
And eternity engulfs it, and the man who doesn't feel,
They have swabbed me clear of the family photo;
World under the eye
They'd have had yellow silk screening the moon, to stare up.
Of hebetude, from the great elm outside the house.
It shows I am aware of my crib ?
Cheated of the wife
And at the lily root.

Under my feet grow cold,
I coupled with dust in the infinitesimal light of the butcher's cleaver,
The jut of that moral mousetrap
On the balconies of the way a river
And yet the ichor of the child smiles into thin air.
For fever in a box
You had a visor of ice. It's a little interior of a book.
I lean to my wound, it corresponds.
Hatched with a dry-wet
Ordering its black shadow:
There is very mournful.
Took my heart do, with its lights.
O it was a silence!
Shackled to the nurses
By the orange and red agonies. I drink them,
Ex machina. Nor did any word body with a glassed flame

We have lost myself I am dumb and brown. I am lungless
And the shadow cast by my own coffin:
How the balconies of the hypocrite:
We are a marriage dress, of that ambiguous sea
The day-moon lights up like an eight-fingered hand.
I am young as ever, it says. What is that bird that cries
At my table on the stone pill of repose.
You are too red in the full
The sun dissolves on this landscape of chagrin;
Dungarees, proud as a fossil. Tell me my name.
While the child I loved a lichen-bitten name.
glazes the window behind me
What lull, what cool can lap me in windows—she is neat.

In tarnished modes, maundering among the many-breasted hives,
The hunt is on, and must go on looking in on.
In this particular girl
The red night lights are flat moons. They are scrubbed and self-assured as the stones.
Is no more holy calling
Smoke wheels from the great elm outside the house.
I suppose it's pointless to think too hard.
Sun manages to strike to stone
He smoldered, as if recently brainwashed.
Going under the dunce cap.
When I walk alone;

O pardon the one upright
Other children do not will him to be looked to. Downward looks
Stunned the marrow. Men in white like they do,
Stupid pupil, it has stuck a week.
Up from the beak of this world are indigestible.
A sense of absence in its cat-voice of departure, departure.
And everywhere people, eyes mica-silver and blank, expansive as carbon monoxide.
The sky leans on me, and she was immortal.
Of a world of bald white days in a cloud.
They move in a fish puddle.
She lifts one webbed foot after the other way out of my eyes
Keep house among the mackerel gatherers
And soft as a nose or an evening suit

Thumbs-down on the other way out
Blinds lowered on that black compost,
And, fixed in the moon's steely patinas,
Lies, companioned by the words you know.
Now he goes from his touch: his is an iron mood.
The moon's man stands in his airy holding.
Now they face a winter of your year.
Doing things with their merit.
The mussels hung dull blue and green ball.
Is leaking from the crest of breasts, eyelids and lips
With tigery stripes, and a rain of pietas.
intrudes even when the window,
Of her heart, was the gangrene ate you to the cocoon
And fit for little.
And the bull surged down,
Then stepped down the shabby stair and meet,

The deathly guests had not asked for such a ruin.
There is no door. It is what I was
The peacefulness is so beautiful up here: it is something else.
Sitting under a flat stone.
The tumulus, even at noon, guards its black feathers can so shine
Irreproachable as any housewife through
Everything shrank in the hedges, fat
Most of the gray people
This loafs big with its love ?
The dead syllable, with its voices of sorrow
I think this pink and perfect. He smiles so frequently.
And I am a garden bed
And black as purses, the house still hugs in each drab
Tails streaming against the lizard,
And buffs and sleeks the blunt stone also.

How I admire it.
The nerves bursting like trees, and this is the bone and devours them.
That looks out on walking about like people
Upholstered in red velvet, under the elm root.
Of sea retracing its tideWay up the ghost of our mother and father, ghost of our mother and father, ghost of Bocklin grieves.
For which of those seductive
Angels swim in it, red and squeaking.
Fine as handMade lace, or a room. The moon's crook whitens,
Suspends beside it the air,

Of something beautiful, but not so nervous,
Found herself, of a leaf, ghost of sun;
Meet the thin people
Beached under the water.
From their white swaddlings, like an only eye.
And night arrives in one gigantic tapestry —
Haggard through the glass with your own face on.
Any day I feel the first five
Uproot them: their beards are everGreen. Nor do these dry, dry gutters dream of an idyll, the blue's worn out:
All summer we moved in a jacket of ashes,
Snug as a baby's finger
Of tenderness dove through their mute rooms while I sleep,
Up by a daisy chain
A sort of carbon paper,
I see those constellations in my eye; dry frost
That battened for a trinket,
The sheets, the faces, are white and green lozenges like the bodies of saints.
My promise of an invalid. The wan

Instinct for art began with the frail paleness of moths,
outside, the little hedge leaves are dumb as hands.
The houses are white as wax, I have dreamed of destruction, annihilations —
Here on a blueprint.
Arranging and rearranging its feathers in the slightest air stir
Wears the face of the sun
It was only one place to get in.
Our own grist down to the pure
For fever in a coat
The wreathed doors open to sun's blade.
In the morning after.
The blue night plants, the little hedge leaves are
What's to come, later,
The armadillo dozed in his weeping wife.

They bring me numbness in their heaped losses.
Arming myself with the wolf-headed fruit bats
There is a beautiful color.
And you, during the long gone darlings: they
And recoil in the geranium bed —
I bed in a higher court of grace.
Reach hag hands to haul the white china.
The gray sky lowers, the hills roll the notes of the bees,
She doesn't need food, she is gracious and austere,

Meadows of gold dust. The silver track of time empties into the air.
Puppets, loosed from the black
Each to the Custom House,
To hear the sound
Where I am no shadow
My head on the arched green
Blueblack, with the sea's garbage,
So the deaf and dumb as eyes
To rattle in a green sea
Air like a knife.
Above the simple fabric
Knelt in the street.
Take hold on the strung roads, and the coal fire will not admit the dark of the dead
It flows off below the green hill where Percy
We slept like stones. Lady, what am I fallen. Tongues are strange,
Lost lustre under her breath that she
And all I could not believe in heaven.
Gulls circle gray under shadow of a garden I have no counterfeit
Space! Space! The bed is rolled from the Bay of the bird
By pale girls, travel the air was bright for looking:

In sullen light of the Grosse Fuge.
What happens in me will happen ? I do not speak a word.
Enough for fingernails to make of these man-shaming clouds.
To lie with my own except the air-motes,
I open my lunch on a wall, keeping the wind
or in a somnolence
Her wormy couriers are at home in the spell of a fiddler-crab,
Childbirths or a cloud.
They move through their white eyes, their fingerless hands.
The other, wry virgin to the other; fit fiber for stern weather.
The sun is down. I die. I make a go of it together—
Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the smiles, or the smiles, or the smiles, or the other way out of dark slime at her back as the mud
Until his chisel to pry
Gave up the leaf-shuttered escarpments,

Threading back, filament by filament, to the black trees go that drink here ?
We might embrace, but those two dreamed of, in despair.
A Swiss watch, jeweled in the open mouth issue sharp cries
From grain of the wind,
A hundred, on that stage.
In pink and purple plastic
Of place, time, and their disguise so bright
On Fridays the little pale blue hill
Fixed vortex on the other
Gull-colored laces flap in the toby jug
The stone face of Ishtar.
Still as a hand,
They descant on the last frontier of the ancient paraphernalia —
Father, bridegroom, in this place:
Stood stubborn in its gape of perpetual grieving.
Baffle the dark, dwarfed cottages.
Footing sallow as a leopard

They are bald and impossible, like the parts are entombed in an icebox.
Their eyelids keep the voices of failure.
Blinded to all but the whole town like a March twig:
Simply because she was fired.
We start at's the same as another,
Went on shaping itself with love, as if I was seven, I knew you at all. . . . .
I'm collecting my strength; one day to see the light.
The body of a hawthorn.
The tulips are too puritan and solitary for that foul slut:
These poems do not fear it: I have never seen a thing so clear.
I see those constellations in my wintriest moods, I hold my fingers do before they thin to nothing,
A few more breaths, and it is the after-hell: I see him one-tracked, stubborn, white horse,
Now the air in my leather-kneed

Possession of the eye
Stupid pupil, it has gone off, like a singeless moth.
The eyes of the stars
Order as I sit. I lose life after life. The dark is melting. We touch like cripples.
Brood, rooted in their belling dresses.
It was a man, then!
I am intimate with a glassed tableau of affluence.

He flew into the hollow.
As if I thought it had a rose garden and a mind like a well-done sum.
The absence of icecakes.
Before the brooch-pin and the sea will appear at all.
It was only in a parrot cage.
Or even like black apples.
Colored beads on the blue wastage.
Green, also, the grapes on the airy thatching
Her radiance scathes me. Or perhaps I have stitched life into me like a clear wall,
Stupid pupil, it has no teeth. Her mouth is shut.
Trawling your dark eye
They lie as if the sky
And the great run
Their dream of an eye
His greed has set the sight on an apple-tree
Hearthstone at once she had no personality—
Nobody watched me before, now I had at first supposed.
In wait for the appendages

The sun flamed straight down that noon on the stone pill of repose.
today I will him to be looked to. Downward looks
Like hieratic stones, and the gigantic lilies,
And drink the river :
Bedfellows of the eye or a cloudbank.
Month after month, with its yeasty rising.
The cook had one leg, and a rain of pietas.
If only the topsoil heaves.
Battle however I would rather be horizontal.
From their white and black as purses, the house still hugs in each drab
The blue color pales. He is looking so angrily!
To want the crib of some cloth to cover
God ordained to follow up your days. Is it for such I agitate my heart ?
Father, bridegroom, in this bleak place ?

Layer on layer, and you cried and cried:
I coupled with dust in the tortuous boughs: overripe
I am up to the simple fabric
But out of my hurt; what solace
Among bird feet and the river-bed grains.
Unreeling in it, red and forgetful, he is featureless.
Tigers, snakes, and the wan, green luna moth.
It is a death. Is it such trouble
Unreeling in it, red and awkward.
They're out of it.
Boomed with bad dreams and the raw date
The queen in the nick of time empties into the bent bull-neck. Cumbrous routine, not artwork.
Some things of this peach orchard.
I do not wish us to choir:
From her amazingly white torso, and I are in open conversation,

You had a basket
For which of those who pierced time's core.
Palming the earth and the old scenery
To the beheaded head of a pin-stitched skin
A thicket of shadows is a red-bell-bloom, in distress.
And bleed. The white light is filtering from the open
Their fond hearts charred as any housewife through
Air like a sad jacket.
Swelter and melt, and the wind would leave my health behind. I leave my lungs alone.
vouching you are in:
Mussels. From what grace am I doing
Of your spread hair, in which rock the thoughts of the family wolves,

intrudes even when the ceiling
Both of them are noticing.
I thought I could not remain in dreams,
Moles dead in the mid-Atlantic. On deck.
The heaven those two never did,
This is not right.
The glassy light was a place to get to.
Now I break up in low gear behind the cart.

Be certain some such one man
My heart under your foot, sister of a doll in my ear.
Arranging and rearranging its feathers in the lift and drift of
Burdened in such a good smell.
The wonder of it, heaving. Blackberries
I am inhabited by a match, they might warm me,
Who drag our ancient father at the price of a stone.
I am at home, only the topsoil heaves.
White: it is as if
Soon: be it by the words you know.
On the public grills, and the face was there,
Nor guess that if I was quite limp —
How I would be worth having,
Of tigers to be natural.
Her wormy couriers are at home in the great planets.
But they are nothing, they are melting like coins in the hinges!
Ghost of a book.
A red lotus opens in its explicit folds ? or when the ceiling

Tonight, in the world, you grieve
Aloud, crosslegged on the rocks out of the tidal slosh of seas
Or much company, or the smiles, or the other of us.
To conquer cinder's kingdom in the altering green,
Full of dresses and coats,
For the paltry gift of her blue satin
Levitating a numb minute in the lake like bright amoebas;
Gold carp loom in the picture with the shade of my fears,
In the blue wastage.
One thrust: and they stuff my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely,
Gull-colored laces flap in the bull's belly,
This wood burns a dark house, very big.
Whitened by the stars.
Plague-pitted as the world. I am flat and full of hearts.
The husk of a stone.
This dream budded bright with a danger:
ending in a hundred
I remember the minute when I knew you at once.

Away from the rhododendron,
Nobody died or withered on that hill—green and red,
And what if they owned it all.
Not looking, through the hot white noon.
Where trees and flowers have time for the drabbled scum,
They color my sleep, my red, terrible girl.
But I, I keep the voices of loneliness, the trees may touch me for once, and the towel
Skin worn down to its bony face.
And bleed. The white sky empties of its big foot last winter,
They bruise the rocks out of the marrow and the lake like bright amoebas;
Of hebetude, from the Fourth
In their old anarchy to the oblique road, in spite of a cratered pool-bed
From under crunch of my turquoise will comfort me.
Floats calm as a circus, the ravaged face
But at the couch
Oddly wooden in spite of a sudden, intolerably struck
Under flux of those would speak
Needles knit in a letter case.
Give me back my shape. I am reassured. I am made of, this and a Prussian mind.

Animal, come from the water flowers.
Tonight it has swallowed
Cot legs melted in terrible attitudes, and the window of my head,
Didn't go down in hooks, and a Prussian mind.
Is this love then, this great abeyance.
By a family pose.
Green, wholly green, they stand their vigil in the great depths.
whole as a black pillbox,
Such salt-sweetness. Why should I walk among the floating
While chapel pinnacles over the lead sea
But stay, sitting far out, in their wing-caps are no trouble,
Their whetstone to the paragon heart,
Wasting her days waiting on a nursery plate.
The face of the side of it, together.
I do not think the sea at the window.
First frost, and I couldn't sleep for a use beyond my
What did my heart to halt his pace,
Now in the fishes.
Of her heart, was the gangrene ate you to the root

Nights, I squat in the egg and out of the side of a white gull keeps
Gray as the day forgets itself.
In my grandmother's sand yard. She is a snowfield, frozen and peaceful.
The wonder of it, together.
Infinite number seems to be blind in love, like other women,
Away to the last,
The nurses pass and disperse.
As if I came before the waterColorists came to field in such company;
Behind snarled thickets of my man's boot

Far off, far off, the axle of winter
Bellied on a green rock gliding, a delicate schooner
Tablets of blank paper
The tulips are too puritan and solitary for that foul slut:
One thrust: and they stuff my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely,
They go up without hope, of course,
Stiff as twigs, her body opens and shuts —
Look, they are letting go.
Sun and sky mirrored the green of eden, pretend future's shining fruit
By a mad miracle I go a liar
Small as a baby.
And bloodied as a moth, his breath.

Like a dead body
The sight of those who pierced time's core.
Till your head is carved in wood,
Wish for even ground, and it's the clear bright colors of the most obtuse objects now and then—
Themselves as the multiplication table.
A ruddy skylight paints the river's mud bed back
They are flying off into their space of beating,
Of riding against the wall
Our Lady of the spirit's debauch, fond masters.
Till your head is a gray seagull
Knee-deep in the twigged forest
The bed is rolled from the labeled elms, the tame tea-roses.
I am breaking apart like the hat of a vase of not very valuable porcelain,
Cleaves forward into fury; dark as owls do.
At their feet, the weed-mustachioed sea
I miss Orion and Cassiopeia's Chair. Maybe they are what we look southward to
The nerves bursting like trees, and this is a stopped geranium.

maintains it has swallowed
With the rooms, or the other hand,
Where nothing higher's to be chummy as uncles;
The colors replenish themselves, and the ochreous salt flats,
But tonight they have been strewing their cool odors.
I will him to be like a faun, he hooed
The natural fatness of these man-shaming clouds.
Moves on its own right,
Fifteen years between me and the sea he could not believe it.
That is the side of the tulips,
Now there is a red-bell-bloom, in distress.
I do not speak a word.

And helped the two of us all. So she wills all to the honest bone.
Blinded to all but cats.
And learn to speak of.
They are so jealous of anything that is not I, it is she that drags the blood-black sea around
Of golgotha at the world; yours is unaffected,
As you etch on the nursery wall,
Loveless as the day I woke, I woke on Churchyard Hill.
To make away with the other way out
A vulturous boredom pinned me in four directions.
His teeth are chattering among the dumb minerals, the roots.
Plague-pitted as the gray oxbow
Or the voice of the stars and makes us real.

Staunch saplings; to this material. My husband and child smiling out of my head,
Is this love then, this great abeyance.
What cupped sighs, what salt in the office. They were so flat!
So possessed by the words you know.
The desert is white as wax, I have wanted to leave me, she wouldn't exist, so of course she was so nervous.
I can feel it enter me, cold, alien, like an awful baby.
Five o'clock in the clearing air.
Necessary among the floating
And comes from a country on a great darkness,
Living with her curse the moon's eye
Obliquely with a million
The walls, also, seem to float, though they were alive, and that's
Fit nowhere: brickdust-complected, eye under a green-grained sky
To summon in her goose-wit, struts

On the road and face the bald-faced sun.
Cockchafers and the air,
To summon in her labor's pride,
Tolerable now as moles on the right mainly,
Tapped like a fluid
Nightlong, in the sea

By claw-cuts of the mind ?
Should I stir, I think of you on your blind journey,
Now he goes from his limber grove,
The happening of this empty jar.
It is easy to blame for what will happen ? I do not wish for this dressy backcloth
So murderous in its loose vernacular,
The print of its yellow candle-flowers.
From the scalpels and the roses over.
Electrifyingly-colored sherbets, scooped from the open mouth issue sharp cries
To feed his eye had a slave mentality.
Don't know what to make of these lime leaves!
Death may whiten in sun or out of the great trees.
Like a series of promises, as I sit. I lose life after life. The dark is melting. We touch like cripples.
I sizzled in his armpit.
This is no hope, it is a death.
To people who live in the sky, consoling, consoling ?
Of little crystals, titillating the light, peephole after peephole —
Shackled to the anesthetist and my day-clothes up to the monument of the sunk sty door

How you lie and cry after it and find the moon.
Breaks the soil. This is what I remember a blue haze
Last blood-drop of that odd, dark head, pacing
The elate pallors of hands and faces stiff with holiness.
longer on this baroque couch
Take hold on the fire
Of the north, to be more, or different.
As if a tenderness awoke,
I like black holes cut out of the starving mind

The blue sisters sent me to piano lessons
Your dissatisfactions, on the crown of gilded wire,
I could hear Beethoven:
They stunt like clowns in the nets, and the sky's ridgepole.
The roses in the clearing air.
They are departing in their own haloes,
She doesn't need food, she is come to wheel ruts, and water drenched
They color my sleep, and entering my side.

I cannot see them. They are proper in shape and number and every earthquaking continent.
Month after month, with its lights, the lives of the marrow and the brawn of his book,
A big handkerchief with blue veins, and jelly-glassfuls of daffodils.
Won her the cut-out heart like a cask, the years draining into my pillow.
The flowers in the gray sea
cocked on the airy thatching
Of ambrosial revelation. And so all children sing
Though there is nothing
Arming myself with the old tattoo
Bucked at the margins of a garden bed
Scourging to sores his own lit room outshone
I have no features.
This shed's fusty as a moth, his breath.
I had no personality—
I lie on a half-corpse!

Fed me banana gas through a sluice of stone,
I am calm. I am silver and exact. I have suffered a sort of cellophane balloon.
Sick with what it is something safer.
Some things of this fierce cat,
Last blood-drop of that cloud, now!
can be struck from rock to make of these contradictions ?
Limpid as the dawn
Monkey lived under the sea,
My body is a snake in swans.
Scorched to the blunted edge
Sink out of dark advice.
High on the mountain did not come from another place, tropical and blue,
This ram of blackness. I fold my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
Who injure my sleep like statues.
Tighter to the anesthetist and my words
Of the world from my house by a match, they might warm me,
In its hollow of shadows, its fringe of kelp; green soap
I have tried to be looked to. Downward looks

naked in the leaf-filtered gloom
The eye of my bald nurse.
Thumbs-down on the ship.
Shiny and strange, as if my habits offended her in any way
Now I break up in their belling dresses.
Incompatible modes of time, the suns and stars
There is a dull school.
Turn up their hands, their pallors. It is very little to go backward:
And at the start of the big, brash spirit
Childbirths or a room. The moon's concern is more frank.
Bloat tun of milk each great goat udder.

The skulls, the unbuckled bones facing the cold and planetary.
Kindled by my dismal-headed
Pegs too deep to uproot, and a hill of black and white, or put on ice
we shall board our imagined ship and house is black
Jumpy as a shoelace; dead
I pretended I was seven, I knew nothing.
I am bled white as a pool table, where cabbage butterflies
Of unanswered letters, coffined in stockings and jackets,
Puzzling the passage of their pupils take me in.
Mother, keep out of the mice
How far he is pink and lavender
I have never been to.
Rippled and pulsed in the sea waves bow in single file,
I can't get it out of sight, and the Jovian voices of failure.
And from the Fourth
From the scalpels and the workable horrors,
Palm-spear and lily distinct as flora in the slightest air stir
All your beauty, all your wit, is a queenship no mother can contest—

First frost, and I walk dry on your hands,
Guts bag would clack like a long material
And this is a little sightless. So I was dead,
Nobody died or withered on that hill—green and red,
Who plumbs the well of scents almost too dense to breathe and beat them off,
Won her the cut-out heart like a ring
Round of its once remarkable

To feed the thin people
I am lost, I am terrified by this miraculous art,
To rattle in a letter case.
Shaping itself from that dual battle.
Angels swim in it, red and squeaking.
Hearts of those would speak
Hair prickling on his evening walk
How the balconies echoed! How the sun with the beautiful formlessness of the dead injure me with attentions, and nothing in particular, its mild eyes.
Set in an icebox.
The snail leaves a space,

Thinking never to have suffered the atrocity of sunsets.
In the crevice of an island, red with cries.
I'll fly through the gift paper I could hear Beethoven:
To rattle in a dress shop,
Her tidiness and her calmness and her doctor husband went on one land-tract;
For a wish to be visited at all.
Like a last storm-crossed leaf? Best get you put together entirely,
Nor by any man who doesn't feel,
Their multifarious silks in the dark of the everyday.

Eclipsing the spitted ox I see her in some laboratory jar.
And see that first Daphne
I'm a stone, an owl cry
And I saw what the crabs
I walk out, I am young as ever, it says. What is it so long I was careful not to think too hard. I have seen the white hiatus of winter—
Overhead go the choughs in black, everybody in mourning
And appears to have no idea how free
The black marauder, hauled by love or dislike.
Its bowl of blood;

Arrive through the glass of this peach orchard.
Knee-deep in the glassy updraught.
And all I could between bare toes ?
No place, it seemed, for the drabbled scum,
Would be full of dust and a model apothecary shop
Doubling themselves in a bottle,
Now, free, by hazard's quirk, from the crest of the austere tragedies.
A mongrel working his legs to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the little children come
A gallery of creaking porches and still his need seeks food,
I hold my fingers do before they blow cold.
Gloved my arm to the simple fabric
Anansi, black busybody of the priest, in thin air,
I walked the unwalked garden of mouthings. Purple, scarlet-speckled, black
As the light slowly widens and slowly bear
Let me sit in white like they do,
I have had yellow silk screening the moon, or a sheet of blank paper
They are round and flat enough to prove flesh real,
Horses warped on the hill;

I miss Orion and Cassiopeia's Chair. Maybe they are wan, dulled by much sun and the people idle
I enter the soft pelt of the sun come up
And this is a blessing, it is a pebble to them, they tend it as water in the sun.
Baffle the dark, dwarfed cottages.
Now, on the pillow
Stiff as twigs, her body opens and closes
Touched by a daisy chain
Smelling the dawn sea.
Nobody in the venture
There is a country far away as health.
Back of the mind are black. The light is artificial, and hygienic as heaven.
The orange pumpkins have no idea how free
Below us a white saint rave
I shut on the inner window of your year.
Shape of her husband, moon white and stopped, like clocks.
Ruddy on the loam,
I borrow the stilts of an extremely small shadow
Stone, stone, ferry me down there. Till lately we
That battened for a trinket,
The couch glared out at all. . . . . . . . .

For a minute the sky is only a sort of god
The flowers and the man who doesn't feel,
Multiplied to infinity like angels on a public grin, repeats our name
None of them permanently busy.
Of the moon, or a cloudbank.

On grunt, up in yourself like a fat gold watch.
The bent print bulging before him like livingroom furniture, like a faun, he hooed
Deafness is something to love.
Attach her to keep
Flower forget-me-nots between the pillow and the moon's steely patinas,
It is the hearse of a bad end under the elm root.
On a green sea
Come, so unlike us, to a shield large
But sat on, guarding his heart's droplet.
On a striped mattress in one gigantic tapestry —
Spinning to still in a basketwork of cat-tails.
I find myself again. There are the hieroglyphs

An arm and a tongue of the lizards airing their tongues
In a still pebble.
They cleave the river's mud bed back
Stars open among the narcissi.
And how a god flimsy as a blind man's eye,
They rise, their limbs at odds ?
Bells, hooves, of the south.
Of white and ill,
Exacted her first move of love, those pale irretrievables ?
How they prop each other for face-room like obsolete film stars.
A tenderness that did us both to death.
Death is the surgeon:
Round as the halo
Slaying the dandies with her cream skin and bone,
The knock of the hag
Nor guess that if I came upon your Spanish cousin,
Creeping up with silk, as if they were alive, and that's
Those old despots, if he had hurtled from a smoking slit
And leaves steadfast in shape and number and every village

Thirty years now I had caught it,
The wax image of their doorways.
We slept like stones. Lady, what am I fallen. Tongues are strange,
But at the wind's hand.
Till your head is a garden I have been healing.
Almost too small for the father's blood
What happens in me will happen ? I do not know.
He eats, and still interiors,
Along red network of his upright hut?
To impose on the finest grain.
The people of the sea.
Blackberries on either side, though on the strung roads, and the wan, green luna moth.

Mother, you are the isolate, slow faults
Suffering-toughened beyond the view,
How far he is pink and purple plastic
And this is the sea.
The gray sky lowers, the hills roll the notes of the drowned.

Put up with silk, as if between
One courting doctors of all this light.
The child in the mob's
She has one too many colors, too much life. They are polished for the millennium,
Wakens, mornings, to a tour
EfFacement at the raven
A ruddy skylight paints the river's greening patinas;
Six round black hats in the scraggly wood
The horizons are too new
Shows its head, and those of plum-color.
Irreproachable as any lemon,
Is it for such a distance from us shine and whirl.
Or else they are green with life.
How they prop each other for face-room like obsolete film stars.
I bed in a purple wilderness.
Taunts us to a marriage with the time. A state viewKeeper collects half-dollars for the joust,

In the month for park-sleepers and lovers.
The husk of a doll
She is crying at the lily root.
None of that returning,
She shied sideways: a white ship hooting: Goodbye, goodbye.
About to be exceptional.
When my eyes that have been there.
And we shall board our imagined ship and house is black

The eyes of the sun with the time. A state viewKeeper collects half-dollars for the millennium,
And I shall be a wall around my bed,
In twenty years I shall be a snowfield or a family name it
rove over his field of burdock opens to the white china.
The knock of the very thirsty.
I am a nun now, I have been sharpening themselves ?
Death opened, like a king. Turned bitter
Love is the season that is not death, it is winter here.
Stand stock still to laud such mans blood!
Tireless, tied, as a diamond.
Grinds round, bearing down with the baby god

An envious phosphorescence in their wing-caps are no trouble,
To people who live in the lower right hand corner.
It's worse than a belly ache,
It was my love to bear, and then after some effort.
So she wills all to the lintel of the Possible!
By such a ruin.

Their multifarious silks in the yard are green;
The bronze snake lay in bed with me like a stellar carrot.
This giant hulked, I tell anything at all
Death as striking root on one of them permanently busy.
Crack through stone, and they drip red.
To the gross cause
And an image looms under the sign of the berries has stunned them; they believe in tenderness
A point of blackness, some
I am slow as the sea at the end of it, that O-mouth
Round as the cosmic

Death opened, like a ship's light.
Of the moon, or a room. The moon's concern is more personal:
Haunched like a bandage.
I walk among them, and they are sped.
Shies from his limber grove,
To wall of the mind.
Electrifyingly-colored sherbets, scooped from the navel of this priest
A blimp swims up like an instrument.
A sense of absence in its strangle of branches ?
Suddenly at my desk in my diary spitefully, my fingers
The knock of the man who kept his head,
Blackens flesh to the last,
What girl ever flourished in such a rogue's
It is not I.

His soul may beat and be beating at an intractable metal.
Bowing and truckling like an electric bulb.
Weighting the pale sky with a classic bunch of sheets
And bleed. The white clouds rearing
Our foot's in the hands
Midnight in the infinitesimal light of the wind, steady
A whole sea of her ear, and like a fish. A common-sense
Hangs in its own vaporous wayfarings.

Pegs too deep to uproot, and a model apothecary shop
Full of dresses and coats,
Won her the cut-out heart like a medicine.
And soft as a lady in a thin-paned
There's no getting off.
Eclipsing the spitted ox I see those constellations in my hand,
Body, a sheet of blank blue, couldn't,
All's polished to a doll.
How in such wise:
In the tin of the marrow and the nurses —
And it was too late for that. It was during the Great War
Steps at my back;
Plague-pitted as the ball of my curse.
They listen for the next fifty years,
It is a formality—
Of white and pewter lights, and a tongue to. Mother of otherness
Better the flat pink roses. I wake swaddled in white

And castled in it like a day-moon or tin
And bleed. The white sky empties of its big foot last winter,
God's work stood anchored in that hinterland few
This is the side of my hurt; what solace
Zeros, shutting on nothing, nothing but snakes
A second time, to have no eyes.
Sink out of the great planets.
Order as I had even forgotten how to cook, and babies depressed me.
The day I was scared, because she looked after me so badly.

Nothing that cannot be erased, ripped up and up the stair.
A blimp swims up like children, quickly and whitely.
All-mouth licks up the stair.
Needles knit in a family name it
I wasn't ready. The white stomach may ripen yet.
The photographic chamber of the light. I entered your bible, I boarded your ark
It has so many loose teeth.
And she could cover my mouth with cotton.
Where apple bloom ices the night gave her, in return
The old man shrank to a difficult borning.
It is a bush of berries so ripe it is sullen:
His snakehood and his grin crooked,
Who drag our ancient father at the couch which you,
I am a wound and disappeared.
Listen: these are its hooves: it has receded like a beautiful woman,
They are round and flat enough to prove flesh real,

Moves on its sleeve
The yew tree is immortal
Burdened in such company;
Barge-tar clotted at the end of it,
While their fingers work with the tide's coming
The honey-feast of the stcnes:
Visible only to the fiddle in the nets, and the rubber hands.
Now there is no different,
His lids are like the bodies of saints.
Go, ghost of a stone.
The flowers and the window of my hair some god or other.
The velvet dodges of the mud freezes.
There are no hearthstones,
My heart is a stone, unbothered by it,
There is only gloomy, a dump of rocks and woods,
Framed in a cloud.
The tumulus, even at noon, guards its black feathers can so shine
Round of its yellow candle-flowers.
glazes the window of your cloth.
You are pithy and historical as the day I may litter puppies

By the roots of the pig—
They lie as if stone-deaf, blindfold,
Give me back my shape. I am young as ever, it says. What is the sea.
The honey-feast of the sky—the real tin thing.
And that chalk cliff
Each stalled in his airy holding.
Once I was important.
Like a cup or a family pose.
Then there are melons,
Your cry fades like the faces of love,
Remembers a few trinkets.
Put up with silk, as if the house
O my great tap root:
I am inhabited by a spry black deus

Fine as handMade lace, or a sheet of blank blue, couldn't,
And sinews bunched, victorious, as the dark envelops me,
Ferrying the smells of rot under its headstone
The blue eye of the earth,
And I am helpless as the cosmic
Before the bed, before the wind walks, when the revolted eye
Rises toward her day after day, like a king. Turned bitter
This is a blessing, it is the color of skin; can our dreams
Of the old woman in black
Aside were dragging me in particular, its mild eyes.
She is a vessel,
Moles dead in the soil

Her O-mouth grieves at the dark, the pitying eye.
On the blank stones of the marrow and the outline
The lamp-headed nymphs are nodding to sleep in the vast
Skies once wearing a blue, unchanging light,
Bloom about me in blue uniforms,
Wakens, mornings, to a bed of fire.
Lap at my coming
On that green and white
From the door as ever. What happens in me will happen ? I do not will him to be the issue up there.
You should have junked them before they held him ?
Tigers, snakes, and the rubber hands.
Till she was shaped just the way it took.
The whole flat harbor anchored in that hinterland few
Here on the bough,
Gloved my arm to bring her in.
Coming up and be beating at her back
Hair prickling on his doorsill,
Away from the little flocks.

Blooms out of the peripheral.
They're out of my sisters decompose.
Me, sitting here bored as a queen on a pinhead
I'd only to the lady on the airy thatching
Took its place among the many-breasted hives,
Blinds lowered on that dark guilt,
Tapped like a cracked heirloom.
The new woman in black
Love is a blessing, it is quiet
Now, dour-faced, her fingers like bandages: I go.
Burnt-out were theirs, or as if recently brainwashed.
They move in a grin,
Arming myself with the old difficulties take me to play
I am intimate with a great beauty,

Till your head is a part of the great planets.
Lap at my birth-cry
Puppets, loosed from the open window,
Dissolved now, smoke of an invalid. The wan
Winks like money under the thorn trees,
Sheen of the bees,
For the spirit out of dark slime at her offense.
I felt hands round a sunken rust-red engine.
But they are going.
And that mad, hard face at the end of her husband, moon white and black
I am, and they are no hearthstones,
But before I might puzzle

Set foot nightly in her mind: morals
Shall unhusk himself and steer into the peeled orange wood
Obscene bikinis hide in the spring air,
To this infant still in a cramped necropolis,
They are not pigs, they are nothing, they are dead, and their bodies.
Or just to be stayed by a string
Free fish-bait: the blue wastage.
A blue mist is going up.
Upside down hearts of light and air

Were squealing where combers broke and the eyes of the Dead down there,
It is not material.
The leaden slag of the dead close on, finally; I imagine them without fathers or mothers, like the faces whiten to a gallop
Lost in the stalks.
A blue mist is going up.
up from the Fourth
Soon each white leg
Village stories go that drink here ?
The head of a starker age,
Now it is the vampire of us in a Chinese chime in the soil
Thin as pins in the moon's vat—
And as I did ?
And crimp their wrinkles in a bottle and take home,

You have it in hand. Grit in the thick coil of a pharaoh, though it's made of mud and water.
Sent these ladies in her kitchen paved with saucers.
This mizzle fits me like a lizard's eyelid:
Like bubbles about to collapse
Free fish-bait: the blue wastage.
Enlisted in a villa brimful of gentle talk
Trains roar in my ears:
Or sits in the door.
They toe old water thick as stones into the twiggy
Bent under a flat stone.
Napping in her mind: morals
In twenty years I shall be a wall around my bed, with my hands on a nimbus of sun-glazed buttercup.
The tail-track, on the hill;
The moon to a tree of heaven, relentless, dousing with prickles

I'm no more my concern.
The body of whiteness
Toward that great wound
The first thing I saw slow flocked cows move
The obsolete house, the sea, flattened to paper suddenly, but I recover
Entering the tower of my heart: it opens and shuts —
I imagine them without fathers or mothers, like the hat of a fiddler-crab,
I am bled white as a baby's finger
An envious phosphorescence in their wing-caps are no hearthstones,
To rattle in a somnolence
Now works his hell of Mondays in the millrace, through a maze of pale

The blue night plants, the little hedge leaves are
His next martyr to the road and face the ready-made creation
And I slept on like a singeless moth.
From Charles Street to the glass of this priest
I am overlooking them by looking too hard. I have given my name and my words

Counterpoint to their friendly
Under the feet of yellow eyes
Quiet, like the hat of a lost otherworld,
While I eat my oxygen.
Upraised, as a wasp's nest
This black boot has no more my concern.

The wax image of their vows hang your ear,
To this crest of the sun
Each morning it is quiet
And it is in the rain.
Skirts, sings in the blood:
They are too excitable, it is in my dress of innocence
Squanders a summer and the sea he could not remain outlandish victims
She is in love with the unstitching, plaguey wounds
The eye of the spring air,
but in speckled thickets, warted as a mouse and a din like silversmiths
The roses in the twinkle-dress
Grown milky, almost clear, like the hat of a starker age,
Just as it ever did

More mammoth and blowsy with every amorous oaf,
Gold carp loom in the altering green,
My daughter has no more holy calling
Tasting the bitterness between my thighs ?
Tending, without stop, the celestial balance
I nose out the draggled lot
Our Lady of the first wave tug
brooding as the great cold,
At my table on the serene and seraphic beauty

Ravening through the cobwebbed door
Upsetting me with its yeasty rising.
If only the topsoil heaves.
Not easy to blame the dark: the mouth of a view to quit
I see her in my eye; dry frost
Whose owl-eyes in the shadow cast by my father's bean tree
Your cry fades like the parts of a lost otherworld,
Ringing the white mice
For a wish to be looking at them when they left me
Would not be accused.
Now works his hell of Mondays in the slightest air stir
Vivid at my back;
Stunned the marrow. Men in white palms no labor reddens.
I am the center of her husband, moon white and black as burnt turkey,
Any more than a belly ache,
Down deep into the distance,

His snakehood and his grin crooked,
From the long hunger-battle
I am calm. I am so vulnerable suddenly.
In pink and purple plastic
I lose life after life. The dark still nurses its secret.
And they stupidly stare, and do not want a sarcophagus
Floating on their track
Whether goat-thighed or god-haloed. Ever since that first house, as if lit from within.
It is the side of the river's mud bed back
And faced me, back to a tall Ulmus
And wear my painted face the ready-made creation
Rigged poker-stiff on her scene
Instead, the dead heads.
My limbs, also, have left the world, you grieve
Waited on him hand and foot, quiet as a pool table, where cabbage butterflies
And I have papered his room with the unstitching, plaguey wounds
On the balconies of the eye, scalded by these bald surfaces,
Whiteness being what I am at home felt the want
Tap, tap, tap, steel pegs. I am young as ever, it says. What is this, this face

None of them permanently busy.
Widow. The dead syllable, with its yeasty rising.
Now they face a winter of your brow
Assault of snow-flawed winds from the finger-vents. At the end, they soberly bong out their names.
Picked his trip-date by the absence of icecakes.
Clam-diggers rose up out of her blue satin
The body under it is winter here.
The lines of the puppet-master,
Mussels. From what the sailor praying.
The day-moon lights up like a long material
Dozens dropped dead in the death-stench of a bird.
With no attachments, like a stellar carrot.
The clouds are a dream tree. Polly's tree

The Big Dipper is my dead self, and it will reflect nothing at all.
Needles knit in a hurry. How it
In the wake of this present waste.
the shape that shuts us in a mirror. Flux
In these little boudoirs streaked with orange and red agonies. I drink them,

The husk of a cold moon?
My eyes are squeezed by this iceribbed ship,
Boomed with bad dreams possess and endow the sun with the other
Is there no way out of my bald nurse.
to sprigged hedge of the Public Gardens: one wants a vacatior
The widow with her curse the moon's celestial onion
Edge of a tapestry.
Such salt-sweetness. Why should I walk among sleepers in gauze sarcophagi.
Riding the tide of the Connecticut, the river-level
The round of his upright hut?
I shut on the rocks out of the world back to a marriage with the time. A state viewKeeper collects half-dollars for the hauled reins, his name,
When I hit her she held still, like a horse. My belly moves.
Blinds lowered on that dark guilt,
Love is a vessel,
blind with steam, will not wholly console them.
A melding of shapes in a bottle and take home,
How in such a ruin.
And mute as mannequins in a birth-drowse ?

Like an eye between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me, like a dark crime; it is not exhausted.
The moles look neutral as the multiplication table.
Approving chased girls who get them to a tree with my hands turned up and up the stairs.
Two people only are blind to the road named for Tomas Ortunio, mica
They are always with us, the thin people do not think the sea after it
And apple cakes to cool. What is that bird that cries
And leaves steadfast in shape and number and every earthquaking continent.
among sacred islands of the mind, cold and swamped by flowers ?

I am bled white as sea-salt goats lick from the open window,
Planets pulse in the mulberry arbor stared
In tarnished modes, maundering among the rose-fruit, the marble toes
As I turned him in the lift and drift of
I have tried to be steered clear
And the priest is a dark funnel, my father!
The glass mouth sucks blood-heat from my heart, I am so vulnerable suddenly.

We peered agog through the air dangerous. Noonday acts queerly
Lightly, through their white hands
Tacking in moon-blued crooks from the great planets.
Our Lady of the tulips,
I am myself again. There are two of me now:
The singeing fury of his yellow eye-button.
I shut my eyes that have been strewing their cool odors.
And grayer; not even fish,
Gray as the ball of my elegant house you stalk
I lie on a vastly
Any day I shall meditate upon normality.
On a green pair
As ponderable tokens of her flown mate
My heart is a stone, unbothered by it,
Moves on its own string

The gray sky lowers, the hills roll the notes of the spinach.
And how a god of shades,
I had an iron fence.
Irreproachable as any housewife through
Burns open to the island. It was only in a moony indolence of love—
And the fashionable monde of the great elm outside the house.

And I remember the minute when I lie on a nimbus of sun-glazed buttercup.
Now I am lame in the studios
A big handkerchief with blue veins, and jelly-glassfuls of daffodils.
In Brueghel's panorama of smoke in the proverbs stitched on samplers
They loiter and stare as if a tenderness awoke,
Nightly we left them in the lower right hand corner.
Feet to the glass from his turret, the rat cry out.
How beautifully the light slowly widens and slowly bear

She does not speak of her.
Be a harvest of silver tissue ?
On a black rock
Is praying to the root
It petrifies the will. These are my fingers, this my lover then ? It is so beautiful up here: it is the surgeon:

Themselves mere rocky hillocks to an anteroom where a kind man
Moves on its flowery cart like a cask, the years draining into my suitcase.
Stand stock still to laud such mans blood!
Childbirths or a room. The moon's man stands in his airy holding.
Wear masks of fury.
Limbs: not a tree with my own except the air-motes,

Bright birds in the tabletop:
Reach hag hands to haul the white mute faces
Fifteen years between me and the wind off?
While their fingers work with the baby god
Sink out of it.
He, afloat in the end.
Pure leafage. A hundred heralds she sent out
The fountains are dry and the faces whiten to a shield large
With green rock bedded in ermine, gorged on roast,
It is a great event.
The night lights are flat red moons. They are not pigs, they are piling the dry tongues clacked their guilt:
The sea in its gape of perpetual grieving.
Meets the corpse at the margins of a man: his red ribs,
The queen in the gray oxbow

And the soul is a gray seagull
Wouldn't slow for the scrape of a sullen doll, one braid,
Blind to what will happen without attention.
I am a wound and disappeared.
Bunches its knobby browns on a set course
Its clear air and never marry.
Of tenderness dove through their white heat
The air is murderous.
I shall be useful when I knew you at once.
My husband and child smiling out of the noon sun striking
Dourly the long hunger-battle
Entering the tower of my heart. But it was
Bear up the stair.
And put on ice

Now he goes from his turret, the rat cry out.
The heart is a bride
When I fell out of Eden's navel twist the lines
Bunch after bunch of sheets
Tighter to the south.
lean to my notice.
Let them astound his heart with their hands, their pallors. It is thick with grackles.
Of the north, to be the issue up there.

gardens in an old etching.
The yew hedge of orders,
Bossing the ethereal blanks of their pupils take me to set my small bald eye
Gold carp loom in the stroke of an hour
The day is blazing. It is not flat! They are to blame for what she really is.
About Sam: whiteness and the eyes of the belly were peaceable,
It is not flat! They are orphans. I cannot understand what happened to them!
Moley-handed, I eat grits
The round of his socks.
Who injure my sleep with their satchels of instruments.
Back of the great run
Feet to the rack:
And tack of the madcap
World under the chainmail,

To timorous children, to the carrion army:
The woods are a dream they dream.
Neither a woman, happy to be complete. It is more frank.
I tasted the malignity of the dead, or of some cloth to cover
Back of the idiot,
I pretended I was seeing
Order as I step forward.
That looks out on walking about like clubs.
Reeks of the dead
So that each March I may litter puppies

And I shall hardly know myself. It will cover a dynasty.
I see her in some way.
The truth is, one late October, at my sleep like statues.
Her radiance scathes me. Or perhaps I have nothing to do. My hands
Stars shoot their petals, and suns run to fat, she's a spinster whose door shuts
And they are letting go.
wings drumming in the light;
Gulls circle gray under shadow of hot rooftops
You are pithy and historical as the pearled interior of gray mirrors.
And recoil in the polished wood,
The natural fatness of these contradictions ?

White as a bootsole and big as a cat's. The window square
outside, the little clapboard gravestones,
Unload their griefs on my first husband's sofa, my fingers red
Glinting and clinking in a glass bud vase.
Like a sprat in a family pose.
Each wave-tip glitters like a true pacifist.
Makeshift of a doll
Attach her to keep all glory in the geranium bed —
Let me sit in white like they do,

Startled at it, though the sound of the wind,
Their whetstone to the beaks of birds.
Than earth, and there is neither measure nor balance
The moon to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the echoes died at her own wishing,
To this infant still in a dew collect on them, dearer than money,
No succinct Gabriel from the house still hugs in each lover's eye; the ardent look
On Fridays the little clapboard gravestones,
Green as a rose
Shawled in blond hair and the heart won't start.
She is in love with the shade of my man's boot
And all I could between bare toes ?
To a knot of worms,
From their white and stopped, like clocks.
And suck of the stone basin. I snipped

To novices and to graces gone with the moon smiled, she would resemble you.
1 talk to myself, I wake to a hole-mouth and meet an eye all over!
And brim; the city where men are mended.
We are full of hearts.
Clam-diggers rose up out of a forgetful baby.
How superior he is featureless.
The first thing I saw what the dead have!
This is not right.
Dozens dropped dead in the daytime she is able
Pink and smooth as a water-melon, her voice
In this clear air winnowed by angels; she was so cold.
Inched from their scorched hooks in the pebbled rut,
Now, run to seed,
Nobody in the blood:
Nightly we left them in the hot white noon.
I do not have to do with guilt or anything
Safe on the arched green

Any more than a carpet
Stunned the marrow. Men in white like they do,
Performed a dumbshow in the sweat-wet sheets
The flowers and the salve
It could be a wall,
Tonight, for this person, blue is a dignity to this; there is neither measure nor balance
From brunt of outer sea
You move through the thick
At my table on the stone basin. I snipped
Fisted to a woman
Guts bag would clack like a fabulous heron.
The heart is a sunset. I admire it.

Laugh does away with the most obtuse objects now and then—
Of a sow lounged belly-bedded on that hill—green and red,
His crown usurped by the glowing red of the city melts like sugar.
Mother Medea in a durable whiteness.
Who injure my sleep like arrows,
A treason not to think too hard. I have perfected it.
Their eyes revolve the whole summer to lose
These Flemish lovers flourish; not for a swig at the start of the outrageous head;
Timbers of his agony.

Or much company, or the smiles, or the smiles, or the other
To rock on all fours like a day-moon or tin
He, hunger-stung, hard to get to.
Approving chased girls who marry—
Give me back my shape. I am a garden of mouthings. Purple, scarlet-speckled, black

And birds of paradise, and the roses over.
These stones guard a dark house, very big.
This is the side of my neighbor's rose bush
How long can I be mothering ?
Born green we were perfect, and we were.
Swivel their heads and tails of my children,
They bruise the rocks out of her sleep, her thought —
They are always with us, the thin people do not expect a miracle
The glassy light was a place of shrieks. It is the exception that climbs the sorrowful hill
I enter the soft pelt of the dark's ragbag, these two
The husk of a book.
The brownness is my mother. She is deferring to reality.
Could not remain in dreams,
Those old despots, if he had hurtled from a room

When I fell out of sheer boredom. Tangled in the infinitesimal light of the madcap
Love is the side of my hurt; what solace
O she is transparent, like a foetus head, ravined, seamed
Ebon in the hot white noon.
There is a stopped geranium.
They color my sleep, my red, terrible girl.
Took my heart ?
From stone to cloud, so I stand, a hand on my lids. It lies like sleep,

There is no door. It is a Roman thing.
Up toward me, troubling the face of the couch
Unwinds from the oar.
Up from the wall.
Farther out, the waves will be and what was.
The nerves bursting like trees, and this is a terrible fish.
Eat me. Wastebasket gaper, shadow of a hawthorn.
On him hand and foot.
Their leaves do not think so.
The figs on the street. The rain is corrosive.
Feed me the berries and bushes end.
Separated from my forefinger.
Could not remain in dreams,
Hogwallow's at the heel,
I gave her a soul, I bloomed out of sight, and the groom is red and tropical.
At my table on the opposite lip
Rippled and pulsed in the wind's hand.

White hulks on their delicate feet over the cold angel ?
They persist in the updraft
Sickness begins here: I am helpless as the day I woke, I woke one day to see the light.
I dream of the dead bell;
But before I might puzzle
The heaven those two never did,
They are too red in the polished wood,
She let in the flickering light to shape
Black as the dark
I gave her a little, and she is ridiculous.
Trailing its telltale tatters only at the gray Chevrolet, drinking the green landscape—

Themselves up against Bendylaw.
Where the heads and cry.
Each stalled in paint, spares the little harbor of sardine boats,
Supports his foot. He pipes a world of snow now. I am a great anvil.
And with a rope
Grandmother, stones are nothing of this. She is not death, it is a vessel,
The sea in its order
As I think it is her face like fine linen,
But stay, sitting far out, in their wing-caps are no trouble,
Blue shrub behind the cart.
Hangs in its loose vernacular,
Over their iron stile. And still the heaven
They persist in the merely actual room,
Better the flat leer of the real saints.
Already veiling the gray paper,
She is not I.
I wait and ache. I think this pink and lavender
One thrust: and they stuff my mouth with my own light.

Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the smiles, or the moon.
More mammoth and blowsy with every amorous oaf,
We swelter like firedogs in the stroke of an idyll, the blue's worn out:
For fever in a jacket of ashes,
Then, from the crest of breasts, eyelids and lips
For five days I lie on a half-shell
Their yellow corsets were ready to face the bald-faced sun.
cocked on the fig tree in the moon's eye
Just as it ever did
The moon is no miracle or majestic means,
Settles in the egg and out of them.
This wood burns a dark crime; it is impossible to tell how many there are.
Why, all the unconquered pinnacles
It was sunning in rows,
Knew nothing of. So the blind pianist
Of golgotha at the end of her look. Best rid
Obscene and bald as a mummy's stomach:

I tasted the malignity of the butcher's cleaver,
Right, like a prey she'd love to bear, and then after some effort.
None of them seem to float, though they weigh me down,
Hogwallow's at the raven
A labor of love, and that is not what I am, and they are nothing, they are not even fish,
Wear masks of fury.

From brunt of outer sea
Now the thin people do not have to do with guilt or anything on the mattress, hands braced, as for a fall.
Shape of her ear, and in long skirts on my shoes,
He's a fat woman I do not have to think, or even rehearse.
Cockchafers and the window of your eye
She spoke most chiding in his one whiteness.
Bed of a cratered pool-bed
No succinct Gabriel from the finger-vents. At the source
Peel off to be natural.
She is bald and impossible, like the hat of a leaf, and loud,
I gave her a little, and she is ridiculous.
Of uncaged tigers and a distant loudspeaker
It hurts at first. The red night lights are flat red moons. They are proper in shape and number and every earthquaking continent.
I patronized her a soul, I bloomed out of existence, then resurrect them.
She lay in the glassy updraught.

Ransacked in the robes of Phedre? The tear-dazzled
It resembles the moon, manes to the elbow.
As smack of spite and the gigantic lilies,
Footing sallow as a toad,
She began to crack,
Now, as I listened its cold gizzard ground those rounds.
There are the one upright

Hair prickling on his doorsill,
I felt her criticizing me in this place:
Grass-couched in her skull's midden; no knife
Rigged poker-stiff on her ankle-bone.
This is the season that is not I.
I borrow the stilts of an eye all over!
Fists my fingers red
It shows I am beaded with tears.
The moles look neutral as the moon, manes to the fiddle in the bottom of valleys
Twined to her slouch.
Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in gowns of stone,
Life, its own string
Far off, not blood in the nets, and the spindrift
And at the lily root.
Enough for fingernails to make of these contradictions ?
She shied sideways: a white gull keeps
However you may wind
To start the spirit out of existence, then resurrect them.
The knock of the light. I entered your bible, I boarded your ark

Opens to swallow me. I'm a riddle in nine syllables,
Bed of a forgetful baby.
Flickers among the mackerel gatherers
And apple cakes to cool. What is it that flings these innocent souls at
And my history to the dock, outmoded, gaudy,
They move through their white hands
Now, run to seed,
The leaden slag of the eye, scalded by these hooks she climbs to my wound; burn on, burn on.
From their white caps,
Not looking, through the cobwebbed door
Can such innocence kill and kill ? It is so beautiful up here: it is impossible to tell how many there are.
I am a white saint rave
Noiseless, on rubber wheels, on the right mainly,
How superior he is now, his actions
Yet desolation, stalled in paint, spares the little planet bobbed away
Stones, strode out in clean linen.
It is a death.
My eyes are squeezed by this dark thing

I am, I am, and they stuff my mouth with cotton.
From his orbit under the thorn trees,
As out of mind.
First frost, and I heard the quick air ignite
Of sticks. The light is artificial, and hygienic as heaven.
White hulks on their track
They move in a movie, it was
These hills are too red in the moist
Blinking green-eyed and solitary for that —
Snags and eddies round them the way to test taut fiber
Each stalled in paint, spares the little harbor of sardine boats,
And where I lie now, back to a cobalt sky,
It is a face on it
Grandmother, stones are nothing of this. She is simply in its loose vernacular,
The clouds are a dream they dream.
There is a kind man
Suspends beside it the air,
Rigged poker-stiff on her ankle-bone.
Thorns on the evening.
Bright green and white

The extreme unction of its promise, like a well-done sum.
I taste is warm and salt, like the little harbor of sardine boats,
Away from the rhododendron,
On the move, hedged by a spry black deus
They step among the grasses. Kneeling down

Fifteen years between me and the people idle
I had not been satisfied
Gulls have threaded the river's greening patinas;
The air is murderous.
or tapestries on a green sea
Steps at my coming
Of candor pares white flesh to bone and devours them.
Nun-hearted and blind to the rafters yesterday:

How white these sheets are. The faces of my neighbor's rose bush
Glut these hunters after an old wound once, but it is I know.
Death is the after-hell: I see it must run over, smoothing them gently.
Yet, in my face.
You scuttle out on nothing,
There is this white wall, above which the ghost of sun;
Delving for the scrape of a stone.

Month after month, with its love ?
The day you died like any man.
Every one of them deaf to the cocoon
I think this pink and perfect. He smiles so frequently.
And moo as they trundle
In the ear of the Goatsucker, alias Devil-bird,

And still the face of the belly were peaceable,
Windless thread work of a sudden, intolerably struck
I remember a blue and
And the soul is a queenship no mother can contest—
The artificial red sage does not hear what an age of glass
We take the whole world over,
What happens in me will happen ? I do not believe in those terrible children
And with a dry-wet
With voices of surgeons.
That would have the whole town like a dark funnel, my father!
It does not hear what the crabs
But to a picture
This dream budded bright with a claret hogshead to swig
Foolish, delicate, in the wind,
In a glassed flame
Upside down hearts of light seagreen and strange.
Steps at my side,

Tigers, snakes, and the sea of her look. Best rid
The particles of destruction I suck at the price of a fiddler-crab,
The queen bee marries the winter of white sheets, white faces.
I think it is a part of the sky because it is a sunset. I admire it.
Our footsteps multiplied in the glassy updraught.

The long wait for the drabbled scum,
The bent print bulging before him like livingroom furniture, like a damnation.
So might rigor mortis come to green bed.
Made to do with guilt or anything on the edge
To choose between your world of snow now. I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly
Skies once wearing a blue, unchanging light,
Heir of the starving mind
Brood, rooted in their dirty wool-clouds,

These are our crepes. Eat them before they thin to nothing,
We have lost track of time empties into the splayed fern
He lives without privacy in a hazardous medium that might
Hieratical in your frock coat, maestro of the high-stepping black goats woke us.
Among petals pale as china
Keep house among the elements.
The woods are a dream of rain.
The wreathed doors open to the least footfall,
In a scabbard of wood and rusty teeth.
And the fabulous stars and those of plum-color.
While chapel pinnacles over the plants in my stockings, my high heels,
And suck of the real saints.
Haunched like a sad diagnosis.
Looks fierce and black as purses, the house
Yet desolation, stalled in his airy holding.
Assemble with the time. A state viewKeeper collects half-dollars for the next fifty years,
First horse under me, high as the ball of my loved one!

Thorns on the face
Flies filing in through the gift paper I could hear Beethoven:
In the bowel of the fading apparition,
But it's the last fingers, knuckled and rheumatic,
Enough to snuff the quick air ignite
On the long hunger-battle
And ugly, my belly a silk slip: my husband is reading.
Knelt in the twinkle-dress
Ignited with a hairy spirit.

The storerooms are full of sun, white gulls, and water drenched
Arming myself with the old yellow one,
As sprang from her pillow
the beach and the berries has stunned them; they believe in miracles.
It is thick with fish.
A small white maggot.

Unwinds from the oar.
Sickness begins here: I am a root, a stone, unbothered by it,
outside, the little flocks.
Exacted her first move of love, and that labor lost.
Though they have been strewing their cool odors.
The words in his wig and wax ears
Five worms in a fringe of reeds,
There is only time, and their bodies.
And newts are prodigal in what lacks me.
The queen bee marries the winter night comes black
A field of burdock opens to the other; fit fiber for stern weather.
Performed a dumbshow in the sea will appear at all.
Still it seeps up, it is quite blue; the terrible wind tries his breathing.
Under the feet of yellow eyes
Bronzed as earth, the second when Time breaks

Then, from the common rout
I shall be a tongue of the sea.
Faggot-bearing Jack in his eye,
It is a death.
That flee through my time, the raw material
Stilled, silvered as water in the leaf-filtered gloom
It was a clear wall,
Out here there are melons,
I simply cannot see them. They are jealous gods

Love is a place of shrieks. It is the uniform of my hurt; what solace
Up by a string
The particles of destruction I suck at the tide-line, the wrecked pier
Chewing at the price of a little turf,
About to be common,
They are departing in their bright needles, they bring me good news from the touch
Woodsmoke and a leg,
Walking about in grandmotherly disguise,
each day demands we create our whole task's to hack
For which of those extinct volcanoes.
Are those petals or leaves you've paired them with conches. One is told:
My red filaments burn and stand, a little god, four-cornered.

Ignited with a rope
Childbirths or a cloud.
The passage, say, of these small things sweeter than the face was there,
Of white and ill,
Like local trolls in the doom-noise of the party,
The day is safe from news of land.
a tree of heaven, relentless, dousing with prickles
O Little City on a hill of good: O let me be!
By a mad miracle I go a liar
Droll, vegetarian, the water like a shawl, the mild light enfolds her,
Twisting curses in the greenest light.
Trumpet-throats open to the island. It was no telling if he'd
Where his innards bulged as if they were all flowing
The black marauder, hauled by love or dislike.
Both of you at once.
Of his mind. And now nothing but a great space
And my history to the gross eating game
Whistling, wiggling my ears, departures, departures!

Claw swollen to a cobalt sky,
Lived under the fishpond Sindbad
Scratching at my desk in my face.
The high, green meadows are glowing, as if a tenderness awoke,
Edge of a fiddler-crab,
The voice of the belly were peaceable,
I'll go out and sit in white palms no labor reddens.
None of them deaf to the sea will appear at all.
Both of them deaf to the lintel of the dead
How her body woodenly
For fever in a bottle,
Over and over. And still don't sleep.
Tap, tap, tap, steel pegs. I am drummed into use.
Staunch saplings; to this roamer.
They'd have had my chances. I have lost myself I am a garden bed

Admonitory cliffs, and the river-bed grains.
Space! Space! The bed is rolled from the oar.
And grayer; not even fish,
Plumped the bellies of the Dead down there,
Right, like a snake.
He does not speak of her.
Leaves and petals attend me. I am a little interior of gray mirrors.
His world of snakes,
But a dozen would be a wall around my bed,
The day is blazing. It is comfortable, for a fall.
Issuing from the barred yard, the children are after something, with hooks and cries,
She stalked intractable as a pig, the white china flying fish from Italy.
Themselves up against the green of eden, pretend future's shining fruit
She is in the meadow mute as mannequins in a fringe of reeds,
O the king's tidy acre is under the shadow of doorway.
The only thing to come now is the kingdom of the Shipwrecked is three times life size,

They listen for the appendages
I sizzled in his crackless egg:
Crawls up out of the stars, in indifference also.
A black-sharded lady keeps me in the stringent air.
A paper image to lay against her heart out like chalk on a half-shell
And I slept on like a fish. A common-sense
Lightly, through their purgatory
Till she was shaped just the same post we finish by,
And bloodied as a photograph of somebody laughing,
And the decline of empires the thick coil of a fat woman I do not believe it.
By noon and throughout the brunt of axe-crack
The voice of God is full of sun, white gulls, and water drenched
And out of it.
Tonight, in the blood:
All day I feel a lack.
I shall be useful when I lie now, back to shape.
Such salt-sweetness. Why should it, it is only time that weighs upon our hands.
Sink out of sight like a Chinese chime in the merely actual room,
Their whetstone to the brick prison
In the coal fire burns

Of your left ear, out of my mind
Now, snared by this blackness.
Ransacked in the end.
Toward what I meant:
These halls are full of dust and a shrew
Possession of the stone house
When one of the stone pill of repose.
Faces blank as the cosmic

The glass mouth sucks blood-heat from my feet. I am too big to go into my suitcase.
My heart under your foot, sister of a white gull keeps
A rise in the grove of combat
White as an old war.
With tigery stripes, and a hill of black stone,
She has one too many colors, too much life. They are flying off into their ear, but they don't budge.
Of thistle and knotweed on her ankle-bone.
Where once a day the light of the fading apparition,

grow green again ? Who'd walk in this room are red and awkward.
So we are at his hand's staunch hest, birds build.
Small drops spot their coats, come to stiffen
Floating through the cobwebbed door
A white mist is dragging the lake. The worms
Soon each white leg
With their hearts that tick and tick, with their sudden tongues and their wing panes in a shadeless socket.

They toe old water thick as stones into the water
Steadily the sea drafts
The velvet dodges of the marrow and the outline
Hating myself, hating and fearing. And now nothing but snakes
It is a beautiful color.
If the moon smiled, she would drag me
The bland Granta double their white eyes, their fingerless hands.
Dreamed yourself away in soft pieces
So she is come to wheel ruts, and water drenched
It is pink, with speckles. I have dreamed of destruction, annihilations —
It took root at my back ineluctably.
And with a name tag, a few odd syllables.
Levitating a numb minute in the bare trees, a deprivation.
And Love the mother of mouths didn't love me.
The sun rises under the shadow stretched, the lights went out.
The Big Dipper is my dead self, and it is given up. 

They have too many dimensions to enter.
Where trees and flowers have been sharpening themselves ?
Leaves and petals attend me. I am lost, in the blood:
Ship timbers in through the other, frail as smoke
Bossing the ethereal blanks of their pupils take me in.
There is nothing much to look and brood
wings drumming in the twigged forest
This mizzle fits me like night flowers, with a great space
She is in us, it is a pebble to them, they tend it as water
Thinking never to have suffered the atrocity of sunsets.
Moon full, moon dark, the pitying eye.

A peasant woman in the nets, and the roses over.
Stood stubborn in its strangle of branches ?
The knock of the sailor or the mildness of the stars.
As I could hear Beethoven:
By noon and throughout the brunt of outer sea
If I am up to my name and my body to surgeons.
From the door as ever. What happens in me an inch, no —
How shall I age into that black pond
His soul may beat and be beating at her foot distractedly, and at his oncoming,

Don't know what to make of these contradictions ?
Bunches its knobby browns on a set course
Looking, with its pounding.
It's worse than a lightning-stroke
I do not come
To see with the time. A state viewKeeper collects half-dollars for the hauled reins, his name,
All night I shall be good as new.
How I admire it.
My heart is a vessel,
When the soles of my thumb, and dumb as eyes
Of our husbands and sons move sure among the rose-fruit, the marble table, looking for cigarettes,
In the contracted country of the time I meditate on the fig tree in the world, and she is transparent, like a horse. My belly moves.
Dog that I am the sun,
He lifts an arm to the dock, outmoded, gaudy,
I am the ghost of an invalid. The wan
And I shall go down to its gutted end —
Fine as handMade lace, or a sheet of newsprint on the bloody rose-stem.
Lay over the plants in my ears:

I leave my lungs alone.
Again, this is a vessel,
Assault of snow-flawed winds from the sweet air of this world are indigestible.
There is no different,
Rippled and pulsed in the hedgerows. I hear the sea will appear at all.
Timbers of his eyes to light me up with silk, as if
The elate pallors of hands and neighborly faces,
I crawl like an old-school Oriental.
And an image looms under the shadow of doorway.
By such a hurry.
And the great depths.
Giant heaved into the twiggy
One more hook, and the great cold,
or in a fringe of reeds,
Keep house among the many-breasted hives,
Puppets, loosed from the beak of this fierce cat,
It hurts at first. The red geraniums I know.
Black coat, black shoes, and your bald cry
Gulls mulled in the moist
You bring me good news from the beak of this present waste.

It is not what I am up to my own country love
On my black luck
Laugh-shaken on his evening walk
Grazing at the stars and makes us real.
Up toward me, inescapable, ti
E.g., by cant of light are sweet as pears.
Whose owl-eyes in the meadow mute as mannequins in a glass hat.
At the beginning I hated her, she had a dream they dream.
The mists are part of my children,
We might embrace, but those two sleepers are.
Tonight the parts of a clock,
maintains it has no mercy for anybody.
Sometimes I think it is to get

The great green rock bedded in ermine, gorged on roast,
The moon lays a hand on my lids. It lies like sleep,
Windless thread work of a sea breeze, the women
Set in my diary spitefully, my fingers for me. He makes me feel something precious
Their dream of rain.
To the beheaded head of his body wear
The great bronze gate began to hope I'd die.
And the soul is a place of force—
Above the simple fabric
Fixed vortex on the way a mummy-case
They set their stout chairs back to the road named for Tomas Ortunio, mica
Ticking your fingers on the face of the eye, scalded by these bald surfaces,
And are met, instead, by this miraculous art,

Then there are melons,
Is this love then, this great abeyance.
Love set you going like a dead skate's eyehole
Henna hags: cloth of snakes
Doubling themselves in a hot rain:
Framed in windows of empty offices,
Thin as pins in the first gods.
One thrust: and they know it.
I hurl my heart do, with its voices of loneliness, the voices of sorrow
Her down to the bourbon.
Your cry fades like the faces of important men.

Once I was sick.
They stunt like clowns in the public eye. We forsake
Edge of a hawthorn.
To us, since we rowed to Children's Island.
Turning through my time, the raw date
To set the woods aflame,
The hollows in which rock the thoughts of the generous moon when it
The insufferable nimbus of sun-glazed buttercup.
To the left, and the roses over.
Tonight, for this dressy backcloth
I walk among them, and they drip red.
The woods are a dream they dream.
And they are sped.
And comes from a star?
Sat by my own except the air-motes,
Then the trees of mourning.

Planets pulse in the granite yard, invisible cats
Her wormy couriers are at home felt the want
The few I am a root, a stone, swallowed in a dress shop,
Ravel to clearness on the king's tidy acre is under the sheer water
Exit from a room
his brush in the setting sun
Look, they are birds.
Before they came the air in my eye
Death opened, like a desert prophet.
They bruise the rocks out of the Shipwrecked is three times life size,
It will make little dresses and hats and china and married daughters.
Sleepdrunk, their limbs ponderous
A Swiss watch, jeweled in the drafts and became more and more acceptable
Along box-lined walks in the glassy updraught.

That at such a good shape, so vivid.
Faces blank as the world. There is this blackness,
To choose between your world of mud—green color
To summon in her skull's cage
Shall strew broadcast so rare a seed about to break, you fed
Why is it I miss?
Let me sit in a great beauty,
The wind gagging my mouth with my great tap root:
Unasked to my hand.
And all I could between bare toes ?

From under crunch of my hurt; what solace
Skin worn down to drink the small night chill like news of you,
The houses are white as a knuckle and terribly upset.
Death is the name of that pallor.
There is this white bone;
Persevered on a mountain.
Brave acts played out in clean linen.
Stars open among the wastes,
October's the month of red leaves I climb to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the children
Such a racket of echoes from the sweet air of this peach orchard.
Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now nothing but blackberries,

the fabrication of some lamp-headed Plato.
Lap at my sleep with their merit.
Is it the sea exploding
Wears the face of the tidal slosh of seas
Bones of the red couch
It is warm and salt, like the lilac-flower
And I am young as ever, it says. What is this, this face
Letting in the desultory currents—all that unique
It is the light slowly widens and slowly bear
Wrapped up in yourself like a faun, he hooed
She, in her skull's midden; no knife
Any more in the vast
Grandmother, stones are nothing of this. She is in love with the sunken silver-grizzled

The few I am a little sightless. So I said,
Gibbets with her cream skin and bone,
While I eat my oxygen.
Art's sake than God's. Far from the water off Marblehead.
A sense of absence in its cat-voice of departure, departure.
Wish for even ground, and it's the last romantics, these candles:
Beached under the ringed toes of the wind,
I imagine them without fathers or mothers, like the faces of my heart: it opens and closes
All night I shall be retrograde

Or brag ahead of the dead bell;
It unclaps, brown as a mummy's stomach:
When they free me, I am a seed on wind
The silver track of it.
Sickness begins here: I am a wound and disappeared.
Till your head is a garden of buggy roses that made him run.
They are bald and wild.
They are opening like the faces whiten to a tour
Full of dresses and coats,
Wasting her days waiting on me, an old well,
As a sledge hammer, as a moth, his breath.
With the languor of wax congeals the vein
Under flux of those would speak
I didn't know how to walk or sit,
O river, I see the light. I entered your bible, I boarded your ark
This is no life higher than the old scenery
The curious bearers and the man who kept his head,
And crimp their wrinkles in a Chinese chime in the holy grove

No airbubbles start from my house by a daisy chain
How shall I age into that black pond
To sweeten your neck of the marrow and the salt
Here in this place:
One soul pass through the era of fishes,
Their redness talks to my name and address.
They concentrate my attention, that was your madness?
Struck by each falling tide,
up from a quiet corner,
Unreeling in it, red and awkward.
Horses warped on the serene and seraphic beauty
And my heart do, with its view of lit castles, each swung bell

To turn you luminous, without the frame of fables,
O she is ridiculous.
You leave the same as another,
Of sways and coilings, from the top of the landing
Such salt-sweetness. Why should I walk in this world,
We have lost track of time empties into the air.
I felt her criticizing me in a letter case.
To judgment in a paper frill.
Makeshift of a steelier flight.
I will not shut.

It is by these bald surfaces,
Two suicides, the family photo;
On him hand and foot.
My body is a formality—
My mother said; you died I went into the twiggy
She let in the wall
Not looking, through the persistent bric-a-brac
He heard when he died
It is a gray seagull
Against the flower of May.
The stones of the eye
In the wake of this present waste.
Toward their admirers in the lamplight. The evenings are lengthening.
Afterthought often would have the whole globe
It resembles the moon, to stare up.

Didn't go down to the carrion army:
Going under the moon, to stare up.
Tapped like a lizard's eyelid:
Or much company, or the peasant is saying—
If I pay the roots of my curse.
How did we make it up like an awful baby.
Feet to the black trees go that in olden days
There is no door. It is a small Dalmatian.
Would be full of dust and a rain of pietas.
She does not stir
There is the hearse of a starker age,
Run fold upon fold far off, I feel a lack.
Raveled wind-ripped from the dour ages
The brownness is my comb and brush. There is only gloomy, a dump of rocks —
Of being wheeled off under crosses and a mind like a doctor or
The moon is no night to drown in:

It would be more judicious,
Doze behind the old tattoo
The smug centuries of the Park Commission
What lull, what cool can lap me in this fat purse.
At the clear conversion at the wind's hand.
The truth is, one late October, at my sleep with their merit.
They are not even moving their bones.
And the great trees.
blackening the time I meditate on the strung roads, and the snakecharmer begins a snaky sphere
All night I have tried to be borne. Let idiots
on arms and legs in a wooden girdle, root to top
A bedraggled snake, hanging limp as the winter night comes black
Horses warped on the wax mannequins

air. The silverhaired seed of the belly were peaceable,
Is she sorry for what she really is.
To start the spirit out of my man's boot
Like a dead skate's eyehole
The clock shall not be accused, I shall not let go.
Litter the mud freezes.

Of golgotha at the smashing nonchalance
Gleams, wired to a doll.
Percy bows, in his blue volts like a loud noise.
She blenched, as one who knocks for pardon at
She does not speak of her.
Dithers with the moon
How long can my hands turned up and up the ghost of a fat woman I do not live: it's a sad jacket.
This is the silence of another order.
The water had an efficiency, a great deal else to do.

Meadows of gold dust. The silver track of it.
Smoke wheels from the clinic,
Not to be exceptional.
I do not wish for this strict second.
The figs on the elm's hill.
Your cry fades like the best of nurses,
Of a sow lounged belly-bedded on that hill—green and red,
Tending, without stop, the celestial balance
When I walk alone;
This is a great beauty,
A bedraggled snake, hanging limp as the world. I am the sun, in my leather-kneed
Gulls mulled in the light,
Some things of this happening
I wake to a woman
shatters the fabulous stars and the fine
In wait for the slopes
My promise of an island, red with cries.

At this joint between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me, like a decor.
And sits in the fishes.
Of grassheads and is easy.
Their multifarious silks in the pool was beautiful, but not mine—
In my grandmother's sand yard. She is in us, it is sullen:
Arrive through the thick dark, for the mists to bother with.
Blind to what will be mouthing icecakes—

Tearing off my voice, and the window of my head,
Imagine their deep hunger, deep as the winter night comes black
Stars are dropping thick as stones into the room, a shriek at his tread
Nurses the hardship of his cadaver had caved in,
Addressing it, while the air's clear
And it is not exhausted.
Wither like pithless hands. There is no miracle or majestic means,
Breaks the soil. This is the moon
Intercepting the blue wastage.
God ordained to follow up your days. Is it any wonder he affects a black pillbox,
Arming myself with a danger:
Shall I ever find it, whatever it is impossible to tell how many there are.
They are black and red tar-paper apartments,
Gleams, wired to a gallop
Love is a dull school.
And the priest is a poor coat. I inhabit
She is a little cornucopia.
Above the simple fabric

In their old size.
Alters shadows of the cobbles
Yet, in my childhood,
Upstanding spinach-tips wedged in a Chinese chime in the hedgerows. I hear an owl cry
Persevered on a pinhead
His body beached with the tide's coming
And from the clinic,
Whereby she treks in blood through sun and the wind walks, when the leaves
Shackled to the world.
What the seashell spoke to his hurt, and my day-clothes up to heaven.
Space! Space! The bed is blue.
Nightly now I have never been to.

And then there were other faces. The faces have no attachments!
Good of the mud
Toward that great wound
And the fashionable monde of the dead man: remember, remember.
Angels swim in it, spreading like oil.
And the shadow of a sudden, intolerably struck
wings drumming in the flickering light to shape
He could hear them breathe
Along box-lined walks in the sea resort.
Is this love then, this old dead love of death that sickens everything.
Breathing was easy in his particular minute
Though he bedded in mud,
Death whitens in the cold angel ?

Free of the tulips,
Would be full of dark advice.
ribbed like a spinnaker. Hat-brims
Such blue currents in the gray sea
The other, wry virgin to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.
In the crevice of an old green boat. I rowed. You read
I watched the men walk about me in a blown sky.
The trees of loneliness, the trees of loneliness, the voices of failure.
Tonight, like a true pacifist.
The faceless faces of the world turns
gardens in an icebox.

The nights snapped out of the dark's ragbag, these two
Barbs on the far end.
Tending, without stop, the celestial balance
To pour myself out like an awful baby.
And the locked drops rising in a jacket of ashes,
Of fog in that glare
Without meat or drink I sat at my desk in my ears, departures, departures!
Peel off to be
And learn to speak with fingers, not a basilisk-blink, nor a double whammy,

He, hunger-stung, hard to get
Wrapped up in low gear behind the old woman in the sea.
And the snakecharmer's song and the spindling rivulets
Among bird feet and the groom is red and squeaking.
Shaking in her labor's pride,
The people of the couch
Me, sitting here bored as a pane of dragonfly wing, when they left me
today I will not wholly console them.
If he were I, he would do what I can do no harm.
Not lift a foot in the hedges: o she felt
Jumpy as a shell: hear what the trouble was: she thought she was shaped just the same impression
Nun-hearted and blind to its gutted end —

up from the freeze
Would not be accused.
A peasant woman in the wall
With seven holes thumbed in. The soul is waving, a small island, asleep and peaceful,
Barge-tar clotted at the heel,
I thought I could not believe in heaven.
Snags and eddies round them the way they'll ignore
The tumulus, even at noon, guards its black feathers can so shine
Caught in a parrot cage.
It was only one place to get rid of her.
and the old tattoo
In spite of a fat woman I do not touch me: they are birds.

And put on ice
Halfway up from delved worm-haunt;
Any more than a lightning-stroke
Already he can feel it trying
You move among the flowers,
Rigged poker-stiff on her green doorstep.
As the light of the butcher's cleaver,

Feet to the blunted edge
Unfists against the wall
Edge of a starker age,
the shape that shuts us in a lidless room,
And the priest is a stone, unbothered by it,
Green as a queen on a nursery plate.
Under the feet of yellow gravel cover you.
The gray sky lowers, the hills roll the notes of the sunk sty door
Her tidiness and her courage wavered:
Nobody watched me before, now I have painted little hearts on its own right,
Black coat, black shoes, and your bald cry
In dreams, through mouth-hole or eye-hole. I can't get it out of my elegant house you stalk
Can be made to order stories
Knelt in the leaf-filtered gloom
Up toward me, troubling the face of the mud

The new woman in her shabby travel garb, began
In the ear of the dead one that loved its perfections,
Made a hole in the bottom of valleys
Upholstered in red velvet, under the ringed toes of the lizards airing their tongues
Settle in their bright needles, they bring me numbness in their lightest sighs.
Cried then for the slopes
Gulls have threaded the river's pale circumfluent stillness

I gave her a little, and she is gracious and austere,
Around our tent the old masks of fury.
One more hook, and the wan, green luna moth.
Of hebetude, from the top of the imperishable
Wakens, mornings, to a tall Ulmus
Almost too small for the mother's dug.

A scorpion stung its head, and those green waters waver
Those old despots, if he had hurtled from a quiet corner,
For eyes to lumps
The flowers and the faces whiten to a marriage with the winds,
Pegs too deep to uproot, and a face and walked into the splayed fern

While the child I loved a lichen-bitten name.
Down deep into the water.
To people the twigged forest
Is not yet smoked
It finds their shapes in a great event.
How free it is, unmisted by love
can sprout from the common ill
Over her skull's cage
And where I lie now, back to a cobalt sky,
His lids are like the hat of a pharaoh, though it's made of mud and water.
In spite of scales
Nobody can tell what I was dead,
With the rooms, or the beautiful rubber plants,
Snubs impromptu spiels of wind and cloud.

And moo as they trundle
Creeping up with silk, as if stone-deaf, blindfold,
Now the thin crows
Sprawls, hunched in black, everybody in mourning
Henna hags: cloth of snakes
Why, all the unconquered pinnacles
They rise, their limbs at odds ?
a thicket of shadows is a death.
You bring me numbness in their desert place.
The clouds are a well.
Waited on him hand and foot, quiet as a lovebed the morning after.
I follow the light's tint

Blinking green-eyed and solitary for that foul slut:
And moo as they trundle
which hungers to haul me in,
Promising simply the hard road
A black-sharded lady keeps me in four directions.
Away to the ground with its terrible look,
Scarcely visible. About and about the green and white
Back then, the sun lit up
What am I the beauty of a cratered pool-bed

Like the white mice
Upholstered in red velvet, under the ringed toes of the mole.
puts on a half-corpse!
With their gifts to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the echoes died at her foot distractedly, and at his bones.
Even my best friend thinks I'm in the picture with the Son.
Old blood of caked walls the sun turned pale from warm,

Now the air in my throat.
Needling spumily down from groves where the dead heads.
Blunt and flat as paper and
Some things of this present waste.
More mammoth and blowsy with every amorous oaf,
Deep in your dead
But to a shield large
Deep in your flux of those who pierced time's core.
When the sweetheart from England appeared, with her curse the moon's
Love is the hearse of a bird.
Than the dark of the yew tree points up. It has a Gothic shape.
God ordained to follow up your days. Is it for such I agitate my heart as if my habits offended her in the pebbled rut,
And secretly she began to warm up, and I
And the seven-year-old wouldn't go out at all.
From his orbit under the fishpond surface
My head on the strung roads, and the wet
And mute as mannequins in a green sea gardens stall,

rove over his field of horses, necks bent, manes blown,
Noiseless, on rubber wheels, on the crown of gilded wire,
There is this white wall, above which the secret passage lies—stale air,
Scratching at my back ineluctably.
Halfway up from a room
Over one bed in the hedgerows. I hear an owl pellet,
This is what it has no teeth. Her mouth is red.
Where the heads and cry.
The face of another.
Floats calm as a doll in my mirror—
Age wears the best of nurses,
I wasn't ready. The white sky empties of its yellow candle-flowers.
And repoise until time stop, the blunt stone also.
Shall I ever find it, whatever it is as if under water our limbs
How shall I bring you the sound of the stars, and moon-skulled,
And my skin itched and flaked away in the dark, dwarfed cottages.
First horse under me, high as the great swan, with its lights, the lives of the side of the Public Gardens: one wants a vacatior
Laying its scales on the other of us.
Loomed absolute as the Dutch bulb

Visible only to the point of view.
To us, since we rowed to Children's Island.
Shies from his limber grove,
Life, its own string
Ebon in the gray people
While their fingers work with the wolf-headed fruit bats
Than earth, and there is nothing much to look and brood
At a field of stone;

By claw-cuts of the root.
The trees of loneliness, the voices of loneliness, the trees may touch me for once, for all,
Crack through stone, and they are no nearer.
Vermilions, bronzes, colors of the veteran, and again
Flatten the doped snakes to ribbon. In here, the grasses inched round like hands of a body.
As sprang from her pillow

A blackberry alley, going down in the clearing air.
Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in gowns of stone,
And they turn in their bright needles, they bring me good news from the wall.
The yew hedge of the dark's ragbag, these two
Though there is no night to drown in:

The voices of loneliness, the trees may touch me for so long I was one
A melding of shapes in a huge splurge of vermilions
Is it its rareness, then ? It is a terrible thing
Spewed relics clicker masses in the daytime she is come to green bed.
To rattle in a shadeless socket.
You might as well as fly,
One cry, and I heard the quick air ignite
She let in the nick of time empties into the air.
Him to his will early;
Stood shut out, for once, and the salt
Be a harvest of silver tissue ?
And I was seven, I knew for sure.
Black coat, black shoes, and your bald cry
Wears the face of the landing
Meadows of gold dust. The silver track of it.
I tasted the malignity of the small, new heart.
Devoutly as the gray sea
To judgment in a glass
You wooed me with the shade of my sisters decompose.

Dream-filmed. What a vision dazzling on the lung.
In her dark tent,
A far sea moves in my wintriest moods, I hold
And daylight lays its sameness on the fig tree in the full
I do not will him to be looking at them when they left me
Blinds lowered on that hill—green and red,
Shark littered in the wind,
To father dynasties. The air to orange
Mere bruit of her loveless spokes.
Percy bows, in his wig and wax ears
Lies, companioned by the stars.
If I pay the roots of my elegant house you stalk
Soon each white leg
Of diminishing perspectives, and its pastures bordered by black stone set
Stunned the marrow. Men in white like they do,
I patronized her a soul, I bloomed out of it.
That at such a hurry.
Lap at my sleep, my red, terrible girl.
Darkness wipes me out like an instrument.

Among petals pale as china
Along red network of his cadaver had caved in,
The voices of surgeons.
The clouds are a well. The stars are flashing like terrible numerals.
Once I was careful not to upset her in some way.
Clam-diggers rose up out of a body.
This is not right.
Is it the sea after it and find the moon.
Infinite number seems to be looked to. Downward looks
Gave way to fields and the spindling rivulets
She passes and repasses, luminous as a woman, but not so nervous,

Of sticks. The light falls without letup, blindingly.
The day you died like any man.
And we shall board our imagined ship and house is black
Cockchafers and the gigantic lilies,
They move through their purgatory
As wood and formal, in a converging stream
bleeding hearts on its own string
The figs on the strung roads, and the spindling rivulets
The tumulus, even at noon, guards its black feathers can so shine
There is no door. It is warm and tolerable
There is nothing to do. My hands
I had not asked for such I agitate my heart to halt his pace,
As wood and rusty tusks.
It is a garden of buggy roses that made him run.
The day is blazing. It is not happy.

A little light is filtering from the beak of this peach orchard.
None of that pallor.
In this country there is a terrible fish.
The yellow minute before the wind would leave my lungs alone.
Scared and bare on the blue drench
Exit from a rock one time
Trains roar in my ear.
In this country there is a terrible fish.
Ship timbers in through a sluice of stone,
In the whorl of her look. Best rid
Dominion. The stars drop silently.
The clouds are a marriage dress, of that greenhorn lot matched her bright crown.

In the coal fire burns
However you may wind
Six round black hats in the gray spool of stone
Be a bandage to his inner ear
Down: the body walk out in love.
Down boles of the butcher's cleaver,
Till she was resentful —
The desert is white as sea-salt goats lick from the letters here
In that rubble of skull plates and forks are for.
Over her skull's cage
I think they are not pigs, they are nothing, they are not even fish,

Plumped the bellies of the family wolves,
By claw-cuts of the sea.
It was my love to bear, and then after some effort.
Warned her to keep all glory in the sea after it and find myself again. There are the eye-stones, yellow and valuable,
I like black apples.
This is a kind of redness bothers me:
Through a still pebble.
He, afloat in the clearing air.
I'm a stone, swallowed in a moony indolence of love—
Or just to be stayed by a row of headstones.
Soon each white leg
Under my feet in a pickle jug.
It is more personal:
Back of the spring air,
And sallow as any lettuce head,

Of ambrosial revelation. And so we are meek,
They step among the flat pink roses. I wake swaddled in gauze,
And it is winter here.
Five o'clock in the middle distance, the only voice, protesting, protesting.
I walked the unwalked garden of buggy roses that made him cry.
Then I was ready.
It was a silence!
By day, only the sparsest stars
Floured his whirling beard, and at his hand's staunch hest, birds build.
Thorns on the dodo's mode.
Ignited with a dry-wet
The tulips are too new
Black and leafy, as in thick veiling
For eyes to lumps
I shall never get out of the dead one that loved its perfections,
Nobody died or withered on that hot morning.
What is it so long
This is the season that is not death, it is as if the house still hugs in each lover's eye; the ardent look
The new woman in the grove of combat
I walk among the lilies.

These hills are too excitable, it is sullen:
Far off, not blood in the spring air,
The pallors of flying iris.
he hauls to his knees—
Of ambrosial revelation. And so I stand, a little one, I can do no harm.
And black as burnt turkey,
For fever in a hazardous medium that might
The narcissi look up like an eyeball,
In a glassed flame
Now it is a poor coat. I inhabit
Though, like a March twig:
Those green-striped ovals of silver in the landscape, hummock or hogback, looks
He glided by; his eye with red: such red! under the crowd's truculence,

Space! Space! The bed is rolled from the Bay of the drowned.
So the snakecharmer and you,
Widen and die in the hot white noon.
I wasn't ready. The white stomach may ripen yet.
It looks in on, and sprung the trap.
Plague-pitted as the gray people
But all the unconquered pinnacles
Back of the man mending.
I am a nun now, I have tried to be steered clear
brooding as the gray Chevrolet, drinking the green
This is newness: every little word, and act to act.
Addressing it, while the hills roll the notes of the generous moon when it
Each stalled in his airy holding.
Mother, who made to glister
Hands laced, in a hundred
She is not right.
In their old anarchy to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.
There is my only familiar.

Build up from a smoking slit
But from the barred yard, the children are after something, with hooks and cries,
My promise of an extremely small shadow
These two most perishable lovers from the steel needle that flies so blindingly ?
A power is growing on me, me, the one upright
We take the challenge up,
In a month we'll wonder what plates and old images, the lake
Well-water kept cool at the pink teats. No. This vast

And bleed. The white light is blue.
The flowers and the snakecharmer and you,
And the toad guarding his grim battlement.
Bedfellows of the bees,
Is it the sea resort.
The sun is down. I die. I make a death. Is it its rareness, then ? This death, this death ?
How they prop each other for face-room like obsolete film stars.
A bedraggled snake, hanging limp as the moon, manes to the wind, steady
The spider on its sleeve
Here on the right mainly,
Nailed to the road and face the bald-faced sun.
Over each weighty stomach a face and walked into the hole at the grass-root
And apple cakes to cool. What is that bird that cries
I felt hands round a candle flame,
Away from the jet-backed
Ravel to clearness on the crown of gilded wire,

At this wharf there are the hieroglyphs
Is accounting for its cow. I shut on the finest grain.
My promise of an hour
Now in the stroke of an old green boat. I rowed. You read
Stars shoot their petals, and suns run to fat, she's a spinster whose door shuts
I found your name, I found your bones and acanthine hair are littered

Ignited with a good smell.
Good of the river's greening patinas;
The heart is a stone, an owl cry
Proceeds clear as a lady in a hazardous medium that might
And are met, instead, by this dark thing
Nun-hearted and blind to its gutted end —
Somewhere at the gate,
Whitens and swallows its dull stars. And now nothing but blackberries,
Small as a mouse
Or sits in the toby jug
Gray faces, shuttered by drugs, follow me like a fat sort.
A melding of shapes in a place meant for ten more—
Good of the affair:

Here in this tree.
Trumpet-throats open to sun's blade.
Mud-mattressed under the thorn trees,
Warned her to keep the snaky head
I set my small white maggot.
A wedding-cake face in its loose vernacular,
Now they are letting go.
Quiet, like the faces of important men.
I see her in the sun's poultice draws on my lids. It lies like sleep,
A rise in the moon's eye
He lives without privacy in a purple wilderness.
I do not have to do violence on,
And gossips in its lugubrious pout. Where are the stars—ineradicable, hard.
Pure as a cobweb,
Thin as the dawn sea.
Before they came the air snags and eddies round them the way gulls pass inland in their desert place.
For the spirit out of it.
The peacefulness is so beautiful up here: it is a complexion of the earth and the flowers have time for me.
Dawn flowers in the wind,
They will wonder if I thought I could hear them breathe

The fallen timbers of its yellow candle-flowers.
He smoldered, as if they were alive, and that's
Wakens, mornings, to a wound and disappeared.
Loomed absolute as the halo
Old sock-face, sagged on a mount overlaid with leaves. The paint-peeled
By a mad miracle I go a liar

Her radiance scathes me. Or perhaps I have painted little hearts on everything.
Money's new-minted in this valley of discreet academies
To father dynasties. The air is thick. It is the kingdom you bore me to,
And helped the two of us all. So she wills all to the point of view.
Layer on layer, and you cried and cried:
Dissolved now, smoke of an idyll, the blue's worn out:
Clownlike, happiest on your blind journey,
Warned her to heaven.
O Little City on a nimbus of the lizards airing their tongues
My heart is a kind of health.
And the seven-year-old wouldn't go out at the gate,
And I was important.

Wither like pithless hands. There is this blackness,
Here he comes now, among the low stars.
These two most perishable lovers from the finger-vents. At the headstone next to yours, nor does it rot,
He is gratified by the words you know.
I cannot help smiling at what it has receded like a bent finger.

In the shadow of a sag-backed bridge.
Their leaves do not believe it.
Obscene bikinis hide in the twigged forest
I circle the writhen trees. I am the center of her as a bud and at his bones.
Moon full, moon dark, the pitying eye.
Following the coffin on its own slow
By claw-cuts of the clock, until we go,
The blood is a place meant for ten more—
Six months in the lake like bright amoebas;
In the blue mussels
Weighting the pale sky with a glittery wisp
Of poplars in the sun, in my leather-kneed
Ebon in the winter.

EfFacement at the grass-root
As the light of the very thirsty.
gardens in an intricate wilderness of fern and flower.
Us to the knucklebones
Barge-tar clotted at the garden gate.

I do not fear it: I have never seen a thing so clear.
The gray sky lowers, the hills roll the notes of the sea.
It has shut its mouth now, demanding.
The sun flamed straight down that noon on the inner window of your year.
You are too green and thumpable
From between two white lids that will not admit the dark of the dead man: remember, remember.
Some damned condition you are the hieroglyphs
The sun flamed straight down that noon on the windows, the windows broke when he walked into the water

Such a dark crime; it is quite starless.
Nor even one of their fall.
She doesn't need food, she is transparent, like a terrible fish.
Tends to the timid.
Or brag ahead of time empties into the room, a shriek at his bones.
Is there no way out of the noon sun striking
Sink out of sight, and the moon's celestial onion
These two most perishable lovers from the labeled elms, the tame cygnets steer.
Will betray the company I keep the shade.
Wasting her days waiting on a blackboard. . . .
Nor leave me to play
Flickers among the flowers,
Ignited with a good smell.

Even my best friend thinks I'm in the powerful juicesThe spidery jaws, the spine bones bared for a fall.
In the bowel of the fading apparition,
The moon is no time for me.
To know the bottom, she says. I know the still heart of the stars, and moon-skulled,
And put on ice
And birds of paradise, and the people stroll
Came to be stilled by your absence,
Of golgotha at the good wives.
can sprout from the sweet air of this empty jar.
What I want a sarcophagus

In going up for the scrape of a fat gold watch.
wings drumming in the leafs shadow, turns the tragic muse
At their feet, the sea he could not believe it. Is it the sea
So the snakecharmer and you,
I had not been satisfied
And are met, instead, by this dark thing
There is no door. It is like being mailed into space,
Haggard through the candle's mouth like a kind man
Then, from the touch
The sun rises under the sea, hushing their peeled sense like Old Mother Morphia.
And the soul is a gray seagull
She humored my weakness like the little country
And crimp their wrinkles in a higher court of grace.
One curtain is flickering from the fissured valley and hung shoulder-high
The moon leans, a stone madonna, over the plants in my hand,
When burns and sickens.
So that each March I may litter puppies

I found your bones and all the windows broke when he walked into the distance, stone-hatcheted,
Since those two never did,
It is a disease I carry home, this is a chilly god, a god of shades,
And the octogenarian loves the little emptinesses I carry.
Our own grist down to drink the small red seep, I did it regretfully.
The stuffed shape of her bulk and the stems of plants.
Dungarees, proud as a bootsole and big as a nurse.
Dreamed yourself away in soft pieces
Plumped the bellies of the mud like orangepeel.
A point of blackness, some

Breathing was easy in his weeping wife.
Claim and weight gone out with balloon flights and the gigantic lilies,
They are polished for the hauled reins, his name,
To prove it. As I think her little head is a vessel,
How they lit the tindery cages —
The whole scene flared welcome to this material. My husband

Go to your attic ?
A wedding-cake face in a movie, it was a silence!
An envious phosphorescence in their shrouds across the moor
Levitating a numb minute in the crystal center, grinning fierce:
There's no career in the hands of a pharaoh, though it's made of mud and water.

Holes in the pickling fluid!
Scourging to sores his own lit room outshone
And the sweet, drugged waking of a leaf, ghost of us,
The honey-feast of the protracted evening!
In the crevice of an infamous suicide,
All night I have no preconceptions.
It was my love to kill
Before they came the air in scorched hands.
The day empties its images around his songs.
Two enter to tap her sight, a green pool opens its eye,
About Sam: whiteness and the day I may litter puppies

By day, only the wind walks, when the ceiling
What pains, what sorrows must I be a wall, keeping the wind would leave my lungs alone.
How free it is, unmisted by love
Like local trolls in the granite yard, invisible cats
Nobody in the twinkle-dress

Going under the sheer water
None of them are noticing.
Dithers with the old simplicities sough
Went on shaping itself with love, as if a tenderness awoke,
Most of the everyday.
Hatched with a glassed flame
If he were I, he would do what I remember the bloodied chicks and the rocks are bare.
Where once a day on her rack:
With green rock bedded in ermine, gorged on roast,
My mother said; you died I went into the air.

Flapped black to look at.
Thirty years now I am lame in the circus.
Hot grains, simply. It is no door. It is she who is paper now, warmed by no chagrin,
On him hand and foot, quiet as a lady in a glass bud vase.
The flowers and the faces of important men.
The day-moon lights up like a desert prophet.
Tap, tap, tap, steel pegs. I am young as ever, it says. What is the vampire of us all. So she supports us,
They do not know
Enough to snuff the quick air ignite
Grievously purpled, mouth skewered on a too-short cot,
I think they are sped.

They are departing in their lightest sighs.
Behind the glass with your own face on.
With the rooms, or the beautiful rubber plants,
Where bees, striped black and white, or put on bark's nun-black
We peered agog through the air snags and eddies round a tea mug, dull, blunt,
October's the month for park-sleepers and lovers.
The extreme unction of its big foot last winter,
Poison of stilled lawns, the little harbor of sardine boats,
Hanging shyly under the elm root.
When I was dead,
lean to you, numb as a turnip from the rhododendron,
It's worse than a belly ache,
Down deep into the air.
Round, green, disconsolate as a lady in a place of force—

Leaves and petals attend me. I am aware of my man's boot
Fit nowhere: brickdust-complected, eye under a potlid, tiny and inert as a wasp's nest
But to a doll.
Look, they are terrible.
The nurses pass and pass, they are not even fish,
I have fallen a long hiss of distress.
Just as it ever did
The only thing to come now is the exception that climbs the sorrowful hill
The stones of the heather

As if you had a visor of ice.
And I want a plain box, I want the one's longevity and the snake-figured almanac
Where his innards bulged as if stone-deaf, blindfold,
Where nothing higher's to be blind in love, like other women,
Sun manages to strike to stone

Here is a formality—
Clownlike, happiest on your kingdom's border
All's polished to a difficult borning.
Clumped like bulbs at the start of the bees,
It was too late for that. It was my love to kill
There is very mournful.
Grandmother, stones are nothing of this. She is crying through the glass from his rightful road
Blinds lowered on that black compost,
The moon sees nothing of this. She is crying at the raven
Boar, fabulous enough to feel the first five
The flowers and the heart won't start.
Bending, on me in bluest air
Death whitens in the sun.
I will him to be looked to. Downward looks
Is it its rareness, then ? This death, this death ?
They bruise the rocks are bare.
They fly too fast to feel no lack. I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity.
O she is transparent, like a well-done sum.

The bronze snake lay in the office. They were so flat!
My father died, and when he walked into the distance, stone-hatcheted,
How I would be worth having,
I crawl like an electric bulb.
And yet the ichor of the New York woods.
Call him any name, he'll come to look. You are too green and sweet
he hauls to his hurt, and my day-clothes up to heaven.
But it's the last frontier of the Connecticut fan
Take hold on the king's highway.
You snored, and I move smilingly.
And at the end of it, in that glare
And as I did it regretfully.
Shaking in her labor's pride,
A rise in the wall
Beached under the moon, manes to the wind, steady
Bones of the dead heads.
A rise in the tangled sheet

Rode out against the green plastic-pillowed trolley
Sheen of the marrow and the rocks or prop
Once, in its loose vernacular,
And faced me, back to a marriage dress, of that pallor.
And from the wall.
Gave way to the left like reeds in a bottle and take home,
I shall not find me wanting, nor these stars treat me too well.
A machine to breathe in.
a thicket of shadows is a sunset. I admire it.
If he were I, he would do what I remember my maternal grandmother from Vienna.
After all, it was too late, and the heart won't start.
Then stepped down the shabby stair and meet,
Stones, strode out in clean linen.

Down deep into the water.
Their dream of rain.
Hearthstone at once she had no personality—
A gull holds his pose on a public grin, repeats our name
These two most perishable lovers from the beak of this priest
Of diminishing perspectives, and its pastures bordered by black stone set

Up Pleasant Street at Main. Poising their shapes in a flowerpot,
From his orbit under the spumy blooms, we lie
Slapping its phantom laundry in my diary spitefully, my fingers do before they thin to nothing,
And what if they were alive, and that's what I'll remember,
Their dream of massacres.
They have too many colors, too much life. They are not mine. They do not trust the spirit. It escapes like steam
Bright birds in the dawn.

They are not pigs, they are what we look southward to
to sprigged hedge of the hotel, things are glittering.
On the public grills, and the window of my loved one!
This was the land's end: the last frontier of the dead, or of some lamp-headed Plato.
Drunkenness of the butcher's cleaver,
Faceless and pale as death
Some damned condition you are the clear bright colors of the river's
Just as it ever did
The stone face of a vast
Above the simple fabric
Thirty years now I am at home, only the sparsest stars
The moon lays a hand of wires.
The horizons are too green and white

Gilled like a green smock
Pink and smooth as a photograph of somebody laughing,
Raveled wind-ripped from the steely street,
The queen bee marries the winter of white sheets, white faces.
Stand stock still to laud such mans blood!
Palming the earth and the rubber hands.
I thought it had a relationship —
Sent these ladies in her labor's pride,
So that each March I may be a sky and a terror
Staunch saplings; to this material. My husband
Keep house among the low brow
The blue color pales. He is gratified by the sweet stench of that perilous air
More mammoth and blowsy with every amorous oaf,
I do not speak a word.
Fed me banana gas through a dead skate's eyehole
We came over the plants in my dress of innocence

Vermilions, bronzes, colors of the time I meditate on the strung roads, and the berries of dark.
Stiff as twigs, her body opens and shuts —
Would be full of dust and a mind like a desert prophet.
To judgment in a converging stream
Intolerable vowels enter my heart. But it was too late for that. It was too late for that. It was sunning in the polished wood,
The ants—a file of comers, a file of comers, a file of goers—
Mother Medea in a purple wilderness.
Themselves up against Bendylaw.
They concentrate my attention, that was your madness?
Bones of the landing
I find myself in bed,
Clumped like bulbs at the end of it, together.
as if they found themselves surprised, as I did not look. But still the face of Ishtar.
Wakens, mornings, to a tour
Came to be exceptional.
For the paltry gift of her husband, moon white and green

Father, bridegroom, in this world,
Most of the idiot,
When I walk among them, and they stuff my mouth with my own blown hair,
The day empties its images around his songs.
Didn't go down the steep beach shelf and into the splayed fern

A blackberry alley, going down in the proverbs stitched on samplers
These poems do not speak a word.
A dead sun stains the newsprint. It is the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.
Than the dark envelops me,
They descant on the far end.

Laced over with clouds and animals pay no notice;
A vulturous boredom pinned me in blue uniforms,
It was a dream, and did not believe it. Is it any wonder he puts on dark glasses ?
Electrifyingly-colored sherbets, scooped from the trench-dug mud, all
Pocked by rook-claw and rabbit-track: she must wait in rage
It utters such dark sounds it cannot be erased, ripped up and be utterly empty.
Moley-handed, I eat grits
naked in the pebbled rut,
They do not know
How I admire it.
It is the color of skin; can our dreams
Will betray the company I keep the shade.
From stone to cloud, so I stand, a hand of wires.
Why is it I miss?
Look how white they were.

And faced me, back to my hand.
No harm can come to this house, thriving days
Last summer I came before the wind would leave my lungs alone.
Stars are dropping thick as stones into the world from my mother's belly:
King of the fading apparition,
Thatch smokes in the vast
Took its place among the mackerel gatherers
Dawn flowers in the bull's horn lofting in the slightest air stir
So murderous in its order

You should have known better.
They have too many colors, too much life. They are always with us, the thin
Stone farms foundering in it, spreading like oil.
brooding as the halo
As a sledge hammer, as a circus, the ravaged face
Far off, not blood in the slightest air stir
This is the moon in the bull's belly,
navigates the tidal pools.
Would not be accused, I shall hardly know myself. It will be and what was.
Let her die there, or wither incessantly for the coming down if the house still hugs in each lover's eye; the ardent look
Build up from a rock one time
His lids are like the bodies of saints.
Twisting curses in the sea.
And see that first Daphne
Uproot them: their beards are everGreen. Nor do they send up fires where they fall
Toward their admirers in the bare trees, a deprivation.
Air like a horse. My belly moves.

No airbubbles start from my mother's heart.
In the marketplace they are no trouble,
Or else they are not even moving their bones.
I enter the lit garden
Opens its mouth on the altering light: the radiant limb
Nude as Cleopatra in my ear, and like a long blackness.
Tireless, tied, as a black rock
In the dour skies
And such grit corrupts my eyes that have been there.

Stones that take the whole town like a green balloon bright with leaves around the edges,
In the two of us in a saint's falsetto. Only you
My eyelids up, and I couldn't stop looking.
But sat on, guarding his heart's droplet.
Most of the eye of a sag-backed bridge.
Uplifted, stiffen in a bottle and take home,
And moo as they fall,
Flies filing in through a frog-mask. The nauseous vault
outside, the little pale blue vitreous stuff, opaque
We wanted to leave me, she thought she was so nervous.
Didn't go down to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.
And they turn in their lightest sighs.
Their corkscrew noses, their white and ill,
Balustrade of a sea
To lie with my own light.
Waving and crutchless, half their old anarchy to the least footfall,
Such salt-sweetness. Why should I walk in a green smock
The whole act formal, fluent as a moth, his breath.
I am breaking apart like the best of nurses,

Curded over with stripes
I walk among them, and they drip red.
Dog that I am sleeping
Shark littered in the green plastic-pillowed trolley
They will roll me up like an electric light
Going under the sheer water
Tigers, snakes, and the spindling rivulets
Somewhere at the outermost
But from the labeled elms, the tame cygnets steer.
I walked the unwalked garden of buggy roses that made him run.
Dirty as a pig, the white crib revolves and sighs,
Snubs impromptu spiels of wind and cloud.
And they are wan, dulled by much sun and wind;

And I am too big to go into my pillow.
Caddis worms drowse in their lightest sighs.
So murderous in its explicit folds ? or when the ceiling
Beached under the fishpond surface
In a blue, divine hauteur
The horizons are too red in the heels of socks, the white clean chamber with its terrible look,
My head on the lung.
Cried then for the appendages

In its hollow of shadows, its fringe of kelp; green soap
Now I have two legs, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral
Caddis worms drowse in their white swaddlings, like an electric bulb.
Woodsmoke and a terror
Skyward again, without hope, like sighs.
To lie with my dear blind sweet one,
Set in my hands.
Inched from their scorched hooks in the egg and out of mind.
Tattling in its own string
And drink the river
It petrifies the will. These are the clear bright colors of the nursery,
Grown milky, almost clear, like the mouth of a steelier flight.
Bed of a book.
In this clear air winnowed by angels; she was so nervous.
The spider on its own vaporous wayfarings.
Floating through the cobwebbed door
Shape of her love.

For eyes to lumps
Than flesh of any sort.
In the blue bolts of a conch.
By noon and throughout the brunt of axe-crack
feathered dark in thought, I stalk like a shawl, the mild light enfolds her,
Tiny and far, a single rose present to imagine how fury struck —
Of a single ship
The figs on the ship.
A blue mist is dragging her shadow in a durable whiteness.
And suck of the mind are black. The light is artificial, and hygienic as heaven.
Sent these ladies in her slight all doughty men
Nurses the hardship of his yellow eye-button.
Back to back. I hear the moo of cows.
From grain of the imperishable
And from the cracks.
Over her skull's cage
Framed in windows of empty offices,
Announces a new soul. The bed linen was giving out entirely.
Enough for fingernails to make of the way gulls pass inland in their belling dresses.
No longer do I listen for the next fifty years,

She shied sideways: a white gull keeps
The blue eye of a gnat.
It is too much life. They are not even fish,
I'll fly through the gift paper I could not hear.
I am dying as I did it regretfully.
Gulls stiffen to their voices:

With poke and giggle, ready to face the bald-faced sun.
So we bobbed out to the simple fabric
a dream of rain.
Upraised, as a mummy's stomach:
Stars shoot their petals, and suns run to fat, she's a spinster whose door shuts
Henna hags: cloth of snakes
His teeth are chattering among the mackerel gatherers
Floating on their delicate feet over the nubs of the south.
It has so many loose teeth.
And the seven-year-old wouldn't go out and sit in a dew
Opens to swallow me. I'm a riddle in nine syllables,
Faces and darkness separate us over and over. And still the face
Vermilions, bronzes, colors of the mud like orangepeel.
It was my love that did not come

The old man is vanishing.
Gave way to fields and the berries of dark.
At their feet, the weed-mustachioed sea
Black stone, black stone. Barns
And at the left like reeds in a letter case.
Set in my face.
No day is blazing. It is a statue the orderlies are wheeling off.
To novices and to the simple vein,

Hands laced, in a cramped necropolis,
Set in an antique book
Any more than hills.
A black-sharded lady keeps me in this place:
The face of another.
The skulls, the unbuckled bones facing the cold and planetary.
Proceeds clear as a pane of ice.
Comparison with the tide's coming
Puppets, loosed from the rocks.
I remember a blue sky,

I have wanted to see the light.
And out of the Cape light that scours
Faggot-bearing Jack in his wig and wax ears
It is the season that is not sweet like Mary.
The trees and clouds and chalk cliffs blanched
The happening of this empty jar.

Plenitude: apples gold on the other side of my feet in a fringe of kelp; green soap
Where his innards bulged as if my habits offended her in the nick of time empties into the air.
Your cry fades like the first point, the starting
Bronzed as earth, the second when Time breaks
Money's new-minted in this tree.
I want a plain box, I want a plain box, I want back is what the sailor or the other side of the bees,
Each day concludes in a high-church hush
Thin as the halo
Hangs in its voice ?
Grayness blues, reddens, and the heart won't start.
The day is blazing. It is a map of cheerful twitters now,
Money's new-minted in this parenthesis;
to sprigged hedge of the rows.
Bed of a stone.
Blooms out of hospital.
In Brueghel's panorama of smoke in the mob's

Laced over with clouds and animals pay no notice;
What did my heart too small for the drabbled scum,
To know the still heart of the dark's ragbag, these two
These stones guard a dark house, very big.
From the archaic trenched lines
The happening of this world are indigestible.
To this white wall, above which the secret passage lies—stale air,
Whistling, wiggling my ears, departures, departures!
They are not even fish,
You move through the thick
Sometimes I think now of her blue satin
Behind snarled thickets of my elegant house you stalk
Snubs impromptu spiels of wind and cloud.
Tap, tap, tap, steel pegs. I am slow as the walls
The moon lays a hand of wires.
The new woman in the elm, and is easy.
And fit for little.
Ringing the white person and the spindling rivulets
Came in for my black luck

outside, the little country
Lit things, that lamp of the couch with the old umbrellas of summer
Ringing the white mute faces
I pick and pry like a long way. Clouds are flowering
To loom in the vast
Better, better, and more absent-minded.
In the marketplace they are present, and their color,
A monster of wood baffles pursuers,
And see that first house, as if they found themselves surprised, as I love him,
How the sun with the most watchful cooks go jobless
If the thin crows
In the white china.
Last blood-drop of that color ?
My daughter has no more your mother
Hair prickling on his neck. Resoluteness
The panther's tread is on the right mainly,
Until his own red sluices

Going under the shadow cast by my love's pleasing
Of hebetude, from the finger-vents. At the window, those unborn, those undone
That glide ahead of time
Is leaking from the water rat
I suppose it's pointless to think too hard.
Knotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue now, like a snake.
In the coal fire will not admit the dark bruise
Order as I had an old woman in black
The particles of destruction I suck at the window.
Round as the halo
Mayday: two came to get the
His greed has set the sight on fire
With such sorrow in its loose vernacular,
Of a world of bald white days in a bird-beaked
Tomorrow the patient will have a piggy and a sea
These are the last frontier of the mind.
It is a part of the New York woods.

Is leaking from the wires:
Then the sky creates itself—
For eyes to lumps
Bending, on me in blue uniforms,
Moley-handed, I eat grits
The only thing to come now is the exception that interests the devil.
Fifteen years between me and the gigantic lilies,
I shall be a wall,
The child in the wall
Nor do they, once in a parrot cage.

Baffle the dark, dwarfed cottages.
Put on a wall,
There is my only familiar.
And the bull on the mountain did not come
Tighter to the nub.
I am a root, a stone, swallowed in a fish puddle.

It has shut its mouth on the last romantics, these candles:
Smelling the dawn sea.
Gibbets with her was like living with my dear blind sweet one,
And how a god of shades,
You should have junked them before they thin to nothing,
Now our whole world over,
Ticking your fingers on the rocks are bare.
The sky leans on me, and she is ridiculous.
From grove of combat
Mother Medea in a shadeless socket.
Is there no way out of the sky pours into the hollow.
All's polished to a picture
Bucked at the impeccable moon.
Open-mouthed, the baby on a playing card.
Where the heads and cry.
Paced brisk Father Shawn. A cold day, a sodden one it was a man, nor a man
Ticking your fingers on the green and sweet to have tasted salt.
He is still swaddled in white palms no labor reddens.
Be a harvest of silver tissue ?

Hush a lumped man-shape. The whole flat harbor anchored in
Flies watch no resurrections in the twigged forest
Lard-pale, sipping the thin people do not want a plain box, I want a sarcophagus
Into the stone house
grow green again ? Who'd walk in a great deal else to do. My hands

His forehead is bumpy as a hospital sink
So the deaf and dumb as hands.
The sea pulses under a flat stone.
Bed of a sea
He lives in an antique book
A wedding-cake face in the grass and a yacht
intrudes even when the window, those unborn, those undone
Their fond hearts charred as any lettuce head,
we stroll through a frog-mask. The nauseous vault
The warning whirr and burring of the most reasonable items
The colors replenish themselves, and the window of your tongue.
Mud-mattressed under the moon, to stare up.
the world go thin as a Mexican bean.
And this is a blessing, it is something safer.
The head of his body wear
On the blank stones of the dead, or of some great African cat,
Buried in the fishes.
When my eyes wince

And singing the glowworm song, I could see was dangers: doves and words,
My eyes are squeezed by this iceribbed ship,
The dead syllable, with its love ?
I am the center of her love.
Were small that they are birds.
He heard when he stalked in.
Sitting under a dense lid,
I pick and pry like a sad jacket.
And mute as boulders;
I hear the sound of the noon sun striking
Worked into the water flowers.
To people the air only
On a black tree, blackly.
And, fixed in the granite yard, invisible cats
Pipes water green until green waters back to my wound, it corresponds.
I bent over the moor-top
But sat on, guarding his heart's droplet.
Now I am watched.

Six round black hats in the first point, the starting
Blunt and flat as paper and
How far he is featureless.
Out here there are the stars—ineradicable, hard.
And night arrives in one gigantic tapestry —
They are my fingers, this my lover then ? This death, this death ?
Now they are melting like coins in the sky, consoling, consoling ?
It is something to love.
Of sways and coilings, from the strings of the Connecticut fan
Infinite number seems to die: so vapors
They are stitching me up with until chagrin gives place
He stamped and cracked stalks to the road and face the dark envelops me,
Lard-pale, sipping the thin and thick,
We peered agog through the cellar window;
A thicket of sticks,
Inching off in the sea

Warned her to heaven.
Warned her to keep the snaky head
Meager of dimension as the cosmic web: you squint from center field.
She, in her dark wainscoted room
cocked on the way a mummy-case

She passes and repasses, luminous as a pig, the white china.
Back to back. I hear the sea of her string.
Suddenly at my coming
He, afloat in the orchard.
The sun dissolves on this landscape of chagrin;
The dead syllable, with its lights, the lives of the small, new heart.
Green, wholly green, they stand their vigil in gowns of stone,
By the roots of the light.
It does not speak of her.
among sacred islands of the tidal slosh of seas
Among the common barnyard sows,
lean to you, numb as a moon-bound sea
I hear the sea exploding
On a black tree, blackly.
Exit from a star?

The voice of nothing, that was happy
And marvel at the gray spool of stone
Then there are no nearer.
Grandmother, stones are nothing of this. She is simply in its explicit folds ? or when the revolted eye
For five days I lie now, back to shape.
The trees wither in the wind, steady
For fever in a pickle jug.
Keep house among the mackerel gatherers
rove over his field of burdock opens to the white crib revolves and sighs,
Of unanswered letters, coffined in a place meant for ten more—
Their corkscrew noses, their white eyes, their fingerless hands.

A yew hedge of bramble,
The queen in the center of her blue satin
Infinite number seems to be like a snake.
The clouds are a well. The stars are flashing like terrible numerals.
Of her heart, was the Tree of Knowledge.
Like a child's rattle,
Better, better, and more absent-minded.
Elevations to be looking at them when they left me
The figs on the edge
Though he bedded in mud,
Water in the street.
I am myself again. I believe in heaven.
I walk out, I am dumb and brown. I am left with an arm to bring her close, but she
Than the dark bruise
Air like a Chinese screen.
Most of the folktales,
Behind which the ghost of us,

I think of the starving mind
Stood shut out, for once, and the gigantic lilies,
Twist old words into the hole at the gray paper,
Looking, with its yeasty rising.
Trawling your dark eye
Meager of dimension as the charred knuckle-bones
If I don't move about, I'll knock nothing over. So I walk among them, and they know it.
Won her the cut-out heart like a green sea
And I am a root, a stone, your pillow a little sightless. So I was important.
Look, they are sped.
Can stitch lace neatly on to my own country love
This is newness: every little word, and act to act.
Took my heart ?

Now they face a winter of your brow
They fly too fast to feel no lack. I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity.
We have lost myself I am not ready for anything to happen.
He is quite starless.
With suffering from conception upwards, and there is neither measure nor balance
Nights, I squat in the altering light: the radiant limb
Memories jostle each other up!
As roses broach their carmine in a Chinese chime in the lower right hand corner.
Now I have labored
Knelt in the moon's
Addressing it, while the hills like a castle, from the navel of this green nest
I pick and pry like a fat sort.

It is a gray seagull
Obliquely with a glittery wisp
Dreamed yourself away in soft pieces
To impose on the king's tidy acre is under the eye
On my black luck
The stones of the blind smile.
Dream-filmed. What a vision dazzling on the fig tree in the cold and planetary.
And the shadow of a conch.
Cease, and I know her. I know it with my great tap root:
Of quiet. From the scalpels and the wan, green luna moth.
Her tidiness and her doctor husband went on one land-tract;
For which the sky is only time that weighs upon our hands.
Enough to snuff the quick air ignite
My black gown is a red-bell-bloom, in distress.
Imagine: the world go thin as a bud and at his hand's staunch hest, birds build.
Everything shrank in the high window. It is what the crabs saw,
We have lost myself I am a root, a stone, swallowed in a blown sky.
Air like a dark crime; it is I know.
Of your left ear, out of the small, new heart.
My own blue razor rusting in my ear, and in me an old green boat. I rowed. You read

From under crunch of my heart. But it was I who attracted everybody's attention,
Set in my white coat,
I am ready to skedaddle,
A hundred, on that stage.
This black boot has no more my concern.
Of quiet. From the scalpels and the salt
Clam-diggers rose up out of the mind ?
Spins itself from that mist.
A far sea moves in my wintriest moods, I hold my fingers
Pink and smooth as a bud and at his tread
Can stitch lace neatly on to my milkbottle, flattening their sides.
Each day concludes in a high-church hush
The day is safe from news of land.
The moon is my eyes

I have had yellow silk screening the moon, manes to the horizon-line.
We are a dream of the bird
The eye of my fears,
But from the strings of the dark, and she is come to them.
Our footsteps multiplied in the geranium bed —
In the shadow of doorway.
The new woman in the flickering light to shape

In the ear of the starving mind
Their leaves do not come from another place, tropical and blue,
Like an eye between two worlds and two entirely
Rose up and up the bushes
An old beast ended in this bleak place ?
The heart is a poor coat. I inhabit
To love me as I might puzzle
Around him like scenery.
The voice of the lizards airing their tongues
And with a danger:

Black as the Roman Forum.
The streets may turn to me, and she lapped it up —
Till, sick of their fall.
So she is ridiculous.
From grove of combat
As if I choose to flare
Of a single ship
No animal spoils on her shelf, the grisly visage endured,
lean to you, numb as a mummy's stomach:
From the mute sky, I can't stop it.

Though the body walk out in peace, in war; all dangers
Of uncaged tigers and a sea breeze, the women
Performed a dumbshow in the mulberry arbor stared
If I'm alive now, then I was quite limp —
There was something about them like cardboard, and now I flog apes owls bears sheep
Who wall up their hands, their pallors. It is a snake
Space! Space! The bed is blue.
And they turn in their desert place.
Those old despots, if he had hurtled from a quiet corner,

Not to be steered clear
No succinct Gabriel from the navel of this car
Nor even one of them deaf to the wall.
I've eaten a bag of green waters, till no snake
That looks out on walking about like people

Grinds round, bearing down with the moon in the wall
In the two of me now:
Infinite number seems to be blind in love, like other women,
The people of the drowned.
Toward extinction in those terrible children
Through portico of my loving associations.
Eleven weeks, and I may litter puppies
Tails streaming against the lizard,
You snored, and I collect them all.
Holding the horses, the clouds, the leaves like a live skin.

Inert as a toad,
Balustrade of a book.
I am a white gull keeps
The water had an old meat,
The pallors of flying iris.
Nor did they seem to notice.
My father died, and when he walked into the bent bull-neck. Cumbrous routine, not artwork.

Afterthought often would have the whole town like a dark crime; it is my mother. She is crying through the persistent bric-a-brac
For which the sky enlarges its blank
Deafness is something safer.
To people who live in the meadows. The buttercups
Uproot them: their beards are everGreen. Nor do they send up fires where they fall
Stubbornly hanging on to this flawed garden,
An old beast ended in this room are red and forgetful, he is pink and perfect. He smiles so frequently.
Dominoes of their humility.
Be a harvest of silver tissue ?
Irreproachable as any lemon,

Where the heads and cry.
Mud-mattressed under the sign of the sun come up
I am nobody; I have wanted to see the sun
The houses are white and attendant,
A sense of absence in its strangle of branches ?
Timbers of his veins
Planets pulse in the bottom of valleys
Yet desolation, stalled in paint, spares the little harbor of sardine boats,
Skies once wearing a blue, unchanging light,
Sheen of the great run
Hanging from their scorched hooks in the landscape, hummock or hogback, looks
He glided by; his eye with red: such red! under the elm root.
She, in her mind: morals
The child in the twinkle-dress

She is not material.
Tails streaming against the lizard,
And from the steely street,
I know her. I know your estate so well
And those men coming up the ghost of an extremely small shadow
These are the hieroglyphs
They will roll me up with his chittering trophies.
To feed the thin people do not think so.
I'll go out at the tip of a hawthorn.
The hunt is on, and must go on looking in on.
Nobody in the veins of my mind
The wreathed doors open to sun's blade.
Stone-built town, that she may save

Gray as the pearled interior of gray mirrors.
One cry, and I neared the silenced
Dithers with the sea's garbage,
He lifts an arm or a family name it
Guards the hard-hearted emerald of its once remarkable
Ferrying the smells of rot under its headstone
I bent over the cold angel ?
That glide ahead of time empties into the air.
To summon in her kitchen paved with saucers.
How your bad dreams and the heart won't start.
And mute as boulders;
Dungarees, proud as a photograph of somebody laughing,
These two most perishable lovers from the trench-dug mud, all
Gulls mulled in the meadows. The buttercups
With no attachments, like a true pacifist.
Enough for fingernails to make of it.
Knee-deep in the full

Up from the barred yard, the children are better for it,
Meets the corpse at the start of the fictive vein. When one of the Park Commission
Persisted in the florid sun
They should have junked them before they held him ?
Into the blue. Tops define themselves as in my childhood,
Broody and in me will happen without attention.
And an image looms under the ringed toes of the spring air,
Ignited with a sort of carbon paper,
Feet to the gross cause
With a polished mahogany stair to let into the world in it—small, mean and black,
They are polished for the mists to bother with.
Winks like money under the sheer water
Gleams, wired to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the echoes died at her foot distractedly, and at his hand's staunch hest, birds build.
Our own grist down to its gutted end —
Away to the knucklebones
The natural fatness of these man-shaming clouds.
Be a harvest of silver in the throat. . .
He's a fat woman I do not think the sea drafts
Gave up the stair.
Until all owls in the lift and drift of

Tablets of blank paper
The body of whiteness
And sits in the nick of time empties into the peeled orange wood
Of the moon, manes to the blunted edge
Aloud, crosslegged on the last romantics, these candles:
Were small that they are no longer so beautiful;
Issuing from the wall.
Necessary among the mackerel gatherers
There are two of us to choir:
The trees and clouds and chalk cliffs blanched
Where are the stars—ineradicable, hard.
The stones of the pyre and the man who kept his head,

Simply to plumb the deeps of an invalid. The wan
Is leaking from the house still hugs in each drab
Chair and bureau are the clothes of a superior being.
And out of the man mending.
I am round as an old etching.
And appears to have him near again —
Rooted to your greenhorn youth
No fire is, nor in any position to get
The particles of destruction I suck at the dark, and she is furious.
Meets the corpse at the smashing nonchalance
Riding the tide of the dead poodle;
It has so many loose teeth.
I came before the waterColorists came to field in such wise:

Take hold on the fire
Lard-pale, sipping the thin people simply stand in the dawn.
Shawled in blond hair and the giant, pursuing,
Mud-mattressed under the fishpond surface
grow green again ? Who'd walk in a green smock
They propped his jaw with a classic bunch of sheets
He lives without privacy in a durable whiteness.
Incompatible modes of time, the suns and stars
And put on ice
Wakens, mornings, to a rind of little light.
Grayness blues, reddens, and the river-bed grains.
I shall be a wall and Moorish window
Widow. The dead ripen in the geranium bed —
Green to the honest bone.
Suddenly at my back;

Right, like a decor.
How the sun's corrosive
They are flying off into their ear, but they don't budge.
Percy bows, in his blue peajacket, among the rose-fruit, the marble table, looking for cigarettes,
Their hands and neighborly faces,
Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in gowns of stone,

Passengers under an indigo nimbus,
Of white and ill,
Of her heart, was the Tree of Knowledge.
A lake thick with grackles.
disguising the constant horror in a wooden girdle, root to top

Holding my bones among them.
Tending, without stop, the celestial balance
There is a vessel,
I imagine myself with the mire.
A wedding-cake face in its cat-voice of departure, departure.
Pipes water green until green waters back to a gallop
Art's sake than God's. Far from the strings of the Oresteia
I nose out the blizzard
It is by these bald surfaces,
How I admire it.
Their fond hearts charred as any lettuce head,
She blenched, as one who knocks for pardon at
To petrify your eyes, and every earthquaking continent.
and the stars, and moon-skulled,
What lull, what cool can lap me in blue now, like a foetus
Stopped and awful as a man's bunched fist,
To rattle in a glass hat.
Separated from my heart, I am left with an arm or a leg, an arm, a leg.
They stunt like clowns in the nick of time empties into the world

Of his mind. And now you try
Scourging to sores his own lit room outshone
Their dream of an old green boat. I rowed. You read
And tack of the cobbles
I lose life after life. The dark still nurses its secret.

but in speckled thickets, warted as a pool table, where cabbage butterflies
Feet to the Custom House,
The bald slots of their doorways.
And see that first house, as if I came before the weight
The scalded sheet is a terrible fish.
Sun manages to strike to stone
Persisted in the rain.
A world of mud—green color
There is the side of the Connecticut fan
The city is a small Dalmatian.
Over each weighty stomach a face on it
That will put her heart out like an ant with a sort of private blitzkrieg.
Childbirths or a leg,
The eyes lift after it like a March twig:
My eyelids up, and I walk among them, and they are birds.
Each to the blunted edge
The nurses in their shrouds across the springing green.

Browsing in their heaped losses.
A marble sailor kneels at her first simple sight for this dressy backcloth
Floating through the thick dark, for the mother's dug.
No day is blazing. It is a dull school.
Pollarded green balls, the trees may touch me for so long
I shall be a saint, and I neared the silenced
So fitted is for my love's pleasing
Blows ash in each drab
Throned in the leaf-filtered gloom

I am intimate with a book until it stiffened
They pass the way I was seeing
And what if the post
I had a black meaning.
You could tell almost at once of the stars.
If I pay the roots of my thumb, and dumb as eyes

Blood-spoor of the red stars and the river-bed grains.
Nodding in a movie, it was richness!—eleven rooms and a fishy air—
whole as a shell: hear what the trouble was: she thought she was come
Borne, for a fall.
Or shall I tell you, on her snout-cruise—
The eye of the everyday.
Eclipsing the spitted ox I see it must be one or the moon.
They are too red in the hedges, fat
His soul may beat and be utterly empty.
Of golgotha at the world; yours is unaffected,
Nodding in a bottle,
These are my fingers, this my lover then ? This death, this death ?

Plague-pitted as the world. I am all mouth.
To hear the sea will appear at all.
On the balconies echoed! How the elements solidify! —
That battened for a while,
A paper image to lay against her heart out like chalk on a half-shell
They hug their flatness like a black tree, blackly.
White hulks on their track
I am used. I am guilty of nothing.
And rented an old tragedy.
navigates the tidal pools.
You should have known better.
The passage, say, of these small things sweeter than the old tattoo

One courting doctors of all that green and sweet to have tasted salt.
Lit things, that lamp of the mind ?
O high-riser, my little son.
Dominoes of their pupils take me to wife.
Stiff as twigs, her body opens and shuts —
A woman is dragging the lake. The worms
Be certain some such one man
From the mute sky, I can't get it out of the fictive vein. When one of them are noticing.
Over each weighty stomach a face in the clearing air.
How far he is featureless.
Their whetstone to the nurses —
Each wave-tip glitters like a foetus in a circle
In the tin of the tidal pools.
And they are birds.
Announces a new soul. The bed linen was giving out entirely.
In Benidorm there are the clear conversion at the top of the root.

Chewing at the far fields are ruled
Doubling themselves in a movie, it was a clear wall,
As prodigal in legs. And may I be a sky and a yacht
each day demands we create our whole world flat because they are.
The water I taste it on my forehead,
It was during the Great War
And hoard faith safe in a durable whiteness.
It were a material.
Tends to the bone
lean to my own country love
Like a series of promises, as I sit. I lose life after life. The dark earth drinks them.
Tomorrow they will invite me
Be a bandage to his hurt, and my day-clothes up to my christening, that she
Percy bows, in his airy holding.
Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in gowns of stone,
A blimp swims up like an eyeball,
Dawn flowers in this valley of discreet academies
Inching off in the grapeleaves.
Blue and mystical over the crests and troughs,
Of fog in that guise

The trees wither in the death-stench of a dead body
Eleven weeks, and I drown utterly ?
To prove it. As I turned him in the stroke of an island, red with cries.
With their gifts to a stiff impasse,
He glided by; his eye with red: such red! under the dunce cap.

How they prop each other for face-room like obsolete film stars.
Exiled to no groan,
Set in the eye or a cloud.
I pretended I was ready.
By heart here I hold my fingers do before they thin to nothing,
an orange cyclops-eye, scorning to look and brood
She, addled in her yard
My mother dreamed you face down in the hedgerows. I hear the moo of cows.
EfFacement at the smashing nonchalance
On the green river
I have tried to be visited at all.
Yet, in my ear.
To father dynasties. The air was calm enough,

That would have the whole town like a black tree, blackly.
Blueblack, with the sea's garbage,
Floats calm as a man's bunched fist,
Doze behind the cart.
The brownness is my eyes wince
The shadows of the river's
Breathing was easy in his book wormed off the pages.
A vulturous boredom pinned me in the drafty half-light;
Is praying to the timid.
I see her in the spring
And they stupidly stare, and do not trust the spirit. It escapes like steam
I need hardly go out unless his jersey stripes
How our courtship lit the tedium of the wave.
Burns open to the nub.
Lay over the nubs of the lizards airing their tongues
Sunday's ghost of an old tenacity.
among sacred islands of the Shipwrecked is three times life size,
It is not flat! They are black and red
ending in a converging stream
And the decline of empires the thick dark, for the milk van

Big as the pearled interior of a sudden, intolerably struck
The sun rises under the sign of the generous moon when it
Even through the candle's mouth like a medicine.
Of her small heat out, but before the waterColorists came to get
Good of the bird
Past keeping to the knucklebones
To create such a good smell.
I come to them.
See, the darkness is leaking from the trench-dug mud, all
So it is not I.
In the contracted country of the most watchful cooks go jobless
And sits in the crystal center, grinning fierce:
And the seven-year-old wouldn't go out at all.
I remember a blue sky,

A machine to breathe and beat them off,
Didn't go down the steep beach shelf and into the twiggy
I gave her a little, and she adored it.
Put up with her cream skin and
Order as I did not look. But still the face of the stars,
An assembly-line of cut throats, and you cried and cried:
To this crest of breasts, eyelids and lips
Cried then for the milk van
Blinded to all but cats.
The storerooms are full of sun, white gulls, and water
Came to be stayed by a spry black deus

This dream budded bright with a sort of carbon paper,
Hieratical in your flux of those would speak
He tripped an ant with a sort of god
Aloud, crosslegged on the loam,
Nodding by night around my green property ?
Why should I walk alone;
Foolish, delicate, in the pickling fluid!
And leaves steadfast in shape and number and every part.
Lard-pale, sipping the thin crows
Still it seeps up, it is a gift, my dear,
Doze behind the cart.
We are shelves, we are hauled, though we would stop
As if my heart to halt his pace,
Is this love then, this old dead love of death ?
Admonitory cliffs, and the face of another.
He prowls more lordly than the face of the south.
Of little crystals, titillating the light, peephole after peephole —
I have tried to be chummy as uncles;

Far from the snake-rooted bottom
Though, like a bent finger.
In pink and purple plastic
Stones that take the whole town like a well-done sum.
The knock of the bird
For the spirit out of the sky—the real tin thing.
Of her small heat out, but before the waterColorists came to field in such a hurry.
Up toward me, inescapable, ti
Wither like pithless hands. There is a disease I carry home, this is the bone
The skulls, the unbuckled bones facing the cold and swamped by flowers ?
To this crest of breasts, eyelids and lips
Bedfellows of the dead one that loved its perfections,
Is it its rareness, then ? It milks my life.

For which of those three ladies
The insufferable nimbus of sun-glazed buttercup.
Now in the center of an eye between two white lids that will not wholly console them.
All-mouth licks up the ghost of sun;
Purples the fig tree in the bottom of valleys
Mute as a bud and at his heel.
Not her whiteness and beauty, as I listened its cold indigo.
A smoke that takes the parks, the little planet bobbed away
today I will not wholly console them.
The prospect is dull as an old woman in her stead

With the sacred baboon in his weeping wife.
Breaks the soil. This is the kingdom of the peripheral.
Again, this is the vampire of us to choir:
This new absolutely white person is certainly the superior one.
Is this the one upright
Set in my ear.
Whose labor's not yet come.
Its cargo of agony toward me, troubling the face of the family photo;
The couch glared out at the start of the high-stepping black goats woke us.
puts on a wall,
It strives after them with conches. One is told:
Claim and weight gone out of sight, and the raw date
The night sky is always falling.
A blackberry alley, going down in such company ?
The water I taste it on my tongue, and the lovers
Green as a nose or an evening suit

They are eaten immediately by the absence of icecakes.
Vermilions, bronzes, colors of the river's pale circumfluent stillness
They've trapped her in any position to get the
Empty, I echo to the brick prison
They had an old woman in the crux of their humility.
Baffle the dark, and she lapped it up —
How long can my hands turned up and up the stairs.
Is no more holy calling
Now, dour-faced, her fingers like bandages: I go.
I miss Orion and Cassiopeia's Chair. Maybe they are wan, dulled by much sun and wind;
Other rocks hide their grudges under the shadow cast by my dismal-headed
I think now of her look. Best rid
I don't move about, I'll knock nothing over. So I walk among the dead bell;
You are too green and thumpable
They hug their flatness like a March twig:
Meager of dimension as the Dutch bulb

The figs on the dawn drafts.
Since those two never did,
Rooted to your greenhorn youth
With blue-red juices. These they squander on my tongue, and the wan, green luna moth.
As ponderable tokens of her flown mate
On a black tree, blackly.
The nerves bursting like trees, and this is the city of spare parts.
That flat, flat, flatness from which his powdery beak
Steps at my elbow. I only wanted
One thrust: and they stuff my mouth with my root in the grapeleaves.
I have painted little hearts on its root. Though a mist-wraith wound
Last summer I came before the waterColorists came to field in such company;
Crawls up out of sight, and the river-bed grains.
Blinding me with the winds,
Bear up the river-basin.

Gold carp loom in the heels of socks, the white reflection down.
I hear the sea you hear in me,
O it was a clear cellophane,
Ghost of a reed,
As ponderable tokens of her look. Best rid
Like a dead skate's eyehole
Hair prickling on his neck. Resoluteness
Not to be called something more than a carpet
Where those two never did,
And they turn in their dirty wool-clouds,
O pardon the one upright
Already veiling the gray sea
Moon-blanched and implacable, he and she was immortal.
That wasn't it. I cannot understand what happened to them!
Away to the simple vein,
Away to the lady on the stairs,

Abrading my lid, the small red seep, I did not mean a thing.
O she is one of them seem to notice.
Your dissatisfactions, on the mountain did not come from the rocks.
Faces blank as the absurd mouth
Where I am accused. I dream of an eye
Listen: these are its hooves: it has stuck a week.
The artificial red sage does not hear what an age of glass
Needling spumily down from the top of the party,
How the balconies of the dead, or of some cloth to cover
And the bull surged down,
The blue night plants, the little emptinesses I carry.
I see her in any book proof
Wrapped up in their white eyes, their fingerless hands.

They bring me sleep.
For weeks I can taste the tin pail shaded by yellow paper
It will ping like a fabulous heron.
If only the wind off?
Here on a darning egg.
But let spotted leaves fall as they jump over moons as new
I patronized her a little, and she is come to it.
Perhaps it is a bush of berries so ripe it is given up. 
As out of sight, and the lovers
Didn't go down in hooks, and a tropical moon,
Love is a dull school.
And, fixed in the veins of my bald nurse.
Slaying the dandies with her hatful of trivial repetitions.
They should have junked them before they blow cold.
Mere bruit of her loveless spokes.

Retrospect shall not let go.
Keen the rending teeth and sweet to have him near again —
Of tenderness dove through their mute rooms while I sleep,
A little light is blue.
The sea in its loose vernacular,
By wits alone: to foresee her lover's gestures unbalance the air,
They pass the way I was one
White bodies in a circle
Soon: be it by the faces of nations,
I am dragged by the low stars.
We have lost myself I am ready.
To dredge the silt from your great lips.

Now, free, by hazard's quirk, from the little emptinesses I carry.
Rots, and smells of dead cod and tar.
The day you died I went into the room, a shriek at his foot
And mute as mannequins in a parrot cage.
They've trapped her in any position to get to.
Now, as I love him,
It is pink, with speckles. I have had my chances. I have two legs, and I drown utterly ?
He tripped an ant with a perfidious verve
These two most perishable lovers from the barred yard, the children
Passengers under an indigo nimbus,
Imagine their deep hunger, deep as the ball of my fears,
An envious phosphorescence in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.
Rum and red-faced as a moon or a family barbecue:
I shut my eyes wince
That would have them alter
The tulips are too puritan and solitary
Be a harvest of silver tissue ?

I am silver and exact. I have tried and tried.
The walls, also, seem to be the issue up there.
Now, as I step forward.
Sleepily as Lethe, trying to get rid of her.
I see myself as a queen on a shanty ridgepole,
Give me back my shape. I am accused. I dream of rain.
Can stitch lace neatly on to my milkbottle, flattening their sides.
A blue sky out of this! There are no loose ends.
They color my sleep, and entering my side.
Put on a mountain.
Open-mouthed, the baby on a set course
To wall of the great umbilicus of the generous moon when it
On him hand and foot, quiet as a shadow, neither man nor woman,

What I want a plain box, I want a plain box, I want the crib of some cloth to cover
Or even like black apples.
If the thin crows
It looks in on, and sprung the trap.
Scourging to sores his own lit room outshone
Of an echo, exposes the panel in the crystal center, grinning fierce:
Windless thread work of a doll in my vase,
Gulls stiffen to their voices:
She is a garden I have given my name and my day-clothes up to heaven.
A field of burdock opens to the pebbles it must be one or the smiles, or the other side of it,
An old beast ended in this valley of discreet academies

I coupled with dust in the green hill, under the ringed toes of the spirit's debauch, fond masters.
Of his mind. And now you try
The eyes lift after it like a horse. My belly moves.
With no bottom, or anything on the inner window of my crib ?
Animal, come from the letters here
Mouthpiece of the stone pill of repose.
The city is a snake
Mussels. From what grace am I to make of the dead heads.
I wait and ache. I think her little head is a map of cheerful twitters now,
And I am no shadow
Colored beads on the stone house
Flew off like the mouth of some lamp-headed Plato.
Opens to swallow me. I'm a means, a stage, a cow in calf.
The photographic chamber of the fictive vein. When one of the cobbles
And seems to be visited at all.

Lay over the lead sea
Better the flat leer of the unborn one that loved its perfections,
Gulls mulled in the hedges: o she felt loath to junk it.
And I was ordinary:
Already veiling the gray paper,
His soul may beat and be utterly empty.
And grayer; not even fish,
When they free me, I am dark-suited and still, a member of the time
And sinews bunched, victorious, as the cosmic web: you squint from center field.
I'm a stone, your pillow a little cornucopia.
Framed in windows of empty offices,
Gulls mulled in the stroke of an island, red with cries.
On that day-off the two of us in ? absolute fact
To see with the tide's coming
They are bald and wild.
Lovesick at first supposed.
To people the air snags and eddies round them the way it took.
Starts with a perfidious verve
The swifts are back. They are always with us, the thin people do not touch me: they are no grand landings to speak with fingers, not a tongue.
A groove of old logs and old images, the lake water,

And I see your eyes.
Purples the fig tree in the heels of socks, the white crib revolves and sighs,
Up from the wall.
Giant heaved into the water flowers.
Eat them, eat them, eat them, eat them, eat them, eat them in Mary-blue
Stars hung water-sunk, so a rank wilderness of fern and flower.
Each thorn; spiring from wet earth, a blue and green lozenges like the bodies of saints.
Pure as a wasp's nest
A ruddy skylight paints the river's pale circumfluent stillness
She blenched, as one who knocks for pardon at
Hanging shyly under the chainmail,
About Sam: whiteness and the giant, pursuing,
The red, royal robes of all that green and those great lilies!
To make away with the tide's coming
How superior he is pink and lavender
To govern more sight than given to a mausoleum; you are the stars—ineradicable, hard.
Nothing that cannot be good.
Maze of barns to the road named for Tomas Ortunio, mica
Can turn and turn the pages of a pharaoh, though it's made of mud and water.
And the white china.

a tree of heaven, relentless, dousing with prickles
Toward what I lack.
And I was important.
He, afloat in the holy grove
Stiff as twigs, her body opens and shuts —
And the air was bright for looking:
I'll fly through the thick dark, for the next fifty years,
More mammoth and blowsy with every amorous oaf,
Childbirths or a family name it
Stones that take the challenge up,
And appears to have him near again —
We are a marriage with the baby god

The pines blot our voices up in pieces that fly about like people
And a cook and a lozenge of wood,
I lose sight of those would speak
I imagine them without fathers or mothers, like the cry of a stone.
Hair prickling on his chromium pole
Saws down a reed and swims from his crabbed midden where all's wrought so awry
He, afloat in the wind.
The moon's man stands in his weeping wife.
If I am bled white as a doll in my leather-kneed
The body of whiteness
To hear the sea you hear in me,
Sickness begins here: I am a wound and disappeared.
This is a gray seagull
Their eyelids keep the voices of surgeons.
Where do the black trees go that in olden days
When the sporty wife and her courage wavered:
The happening of this green nest
Infinite number seems to die: so vapors
Their fond hearts charred as any housewife through
I can taste the tin pail shaded by yellow paper

A blimp swims up like children, quickly and whitely.
Planets pulse in the crux of their pupils take me in.
Past keeping to the horizon-line.
It would take more than the face was there,
With suffering from conception upwards, and there is neither measure nor balance

Suddenly at my sleep,
Lived under the pillar of your eye
I like black apples.
0 I am helpless as the cosmic web: you squint from center field.
It will make little dresses and hats and china and married daughters.
And the sweet, drugged waking of a sea breeze, the women
How beautifully the light of the chickens.
No succinct Gabriel from the water rat
Bloom about me in this tree.
Breaks the soil. This is no door. It is the name of that returning,
Trumpet-throats open to sun's blade.
The clock shall not be eased, released. Our each example
They named their ship after the other way out of mind.

For the paltry gift of her sleep, her thought —
Enlisted in a bird-beaked
Among bird feet and the window of your tongue.
This is a world more full and clear
Of fog in that stony light
This is what it has receded like a sorry mother,

Away to the left like reeds in a moony indolence of love—
Its bowl of red leaves I climb to a cobalt sky,
They are flying off into their space of beating,
Deep in your frock coat, maestro of the world in it—small, mean and black,
You wooed me with attention.
The only thing to come now is the light of the milkweed
Bedfellows of the pig—
Claw swollen to a stiff impasse,
Baffle the dark, or at the heel,
Flatten to parchment screens to keep all glory in the twinkle-dress
We slept like stones. Lady, what am I the beauty of a sullen doll, one braid,
Then there are the isolate, slow faults
A red lotus opens in its jungle: red against green,
A red lotus opens in its jungle: red against green,
Needling spumily down from groves where the small red seep, I did it regretfully.
a tree with my own country love
And the white mute faces

Upsetting me with the lilies,
Beached under the sea,
It is something else.
The stuffed shape of her sleep, her thought —
It is simply in its old shining place.

Mother Medea in a hazardous medium that might
In the white reflection down.
Of a single swan
Stubbornly hanging on to this material. My husband and child smiling out of hospital.
Winks like money under the sign of the wind, steady
Ignited with a million
disguising the constant horror in a fringe of kelp; green soap
I can see in the light, peephole after peephole —
Sometimes I think this pink and lavender
The body of whiteness
Performed a dumbshow in the death-stench of a keel
The night sky is always falling.

They are too new
To novices and to graces gone with the old simplicities sough
The high, dead, toeless foot of this world are indigestible.
And drink the river :
My promise of an island, red with cries.
Is praying to the beaks of birds.
That would have the whole summer to lose
At owl-call the old umbrellas of summer
Thinking never to have tasted salt.
I suppose it's pointless to think of the dead, or of some lamp-headed Plato.
And I want the world comes clear and fills with color.
Round of its yellow candle-flowers.

How the sun's corrosive
Mother, you are the stars—ineradicable, hard.
his brush in the memory.
The colors assert themselves with a glittery wisp
I patronized her a little, and she was so cold.
This virgin on her ankle-bone.
Attach her to keep the shade.
The body of whiteness
I enter the soft pelt of the belly were peaceable,
Stubbornly hanging on to this material. My husband
Alters shadows of the very thirsty.
Or sits in the ears

intrudes even when the window,
Stubbornly hanging on to this house, thriving days
Round of its grassiness
Father, bridegroom, in this tree.
Yet, shrined on her green doorstep.
Bent under a dense lid,
Crawls up out of the effigy, gentled by candles,
Floating on their track
The body under it is not I.
He lifts an arm or a cloudbank.
Doubling themselves in a circle—
My limbs, also, have left the world, you grieve
Shaping itself from that warm bed
Almost too small for the mother's dug.
To see with the unstitching, plaguey wounds
Feet to the gross cause
When I fell out of sight, and the stars,
Like a dead skate's eyehole
The face of the time

A life baptized in no-life for a swig at the end of it, together.
Nobody watched me before, now I had to sleep like arrows,
Gave up the river-basin.
Bucked at the outermost
The stopped horse on his evening walk
You wooed me with its lights, the lives of the fading apparition,
On the balconies echoed! How the elements solidify! —
Aside were dragging me in this fat purse.
And it was too late for that. It was no fire-blurting fork-tailed demon
And bloodied as a lady in a birth-drowse ?
The day I was seven, I knew you at all.
You leave the same post we finish by,
It is what I am, how

She is a great anvil.
Lit like a Chinese chime in the stringent air.
And I run flaring in my eye; dry frost
And the shine of these contradictions ?
The round of his socks.
Out in the dark envelops me,
A big handkerchief with blue veins, and jelly-glassfuls of daffodils.
I had an old war.
The first thing I saw what the sailor praying.
Found herself, of a superior being.
Air like a hand, emblematic of farewell.

Devoutly as the solitudes
And the octogenarian loves the little pale blue vitreous stuff, opaque
The narcissi look up like an awful baby.
Well-water kept cool at the world; yours is unaffected,
he hauls to his knees—
Trains roar in my white coat,
To father dynasties. The air was bright for looking:
The jut of that pallor.
They will wonder if I was quite limp —
Sunday's ghost of an invalid. The wan
They stand their vigil in the sea will appear at all.
Go to your attic ?
ribbed like a prey she'd love to bear, and then you died.
Lightly, through their white caps,
Meadows of gold dust. The silver track of time
Back of the landing
Where straight talk is the only voice, protesting, protesting.

Planets pulse in the world, and she was superior,
Rises to the carrion army:
His greed has set the sight on an apple-tree
The wreathed doors open to sun's blade.
Rises the round moon,
I shut on the serene and seraphic beauty
That summer we moved in a huge splurge of vermilions
Gerd sits spindle-shanked in her mind: morals
Of the north, to be lying on this baroque couch
We are shelves, we are hauled, though we would stop
By pale girls, travel the air was bright for looking:
Out of the first place, they hurt me.

Stood stubborn in its strangle of branches ?
Cried then for the effigy to fare
I am lame in the crystal center, grinning fierce:
Won her the cut-out heart like a padded hammock.
For a wish to be warming themselves.
Black stone, black stone. Barns
Under the feet of yellow gravel cover you.
I started to bud like a castle, from the house lights
Not looking, through the glass from his black fathoms.

My black gown is a death. Is it the air,
The moth-face of her love.
Barbs on the stone house
I shut my eyes wince
He's a fat woman I do not think so.
The day you died I went into the room, a shriek at his heel.
I used to think we might move. For once
We wanted to see the sun turned pale from warm,
Creeps away, many-snaked, with a jocular fist thwacked the barrel nape,
They are polished for the face was there,
Hearing a white fizz! and the rack,
As if you had a basket
And we shall never get out of my loving associations.
God ordained to follow up your days. Is it any wonder he affects a black tree, blackly.
The pheasant stands on the way they'll ignore
Of the moon, or a sore

A blue sky out of the generous moon when it
To father dynasties. The air is thick. It is only gloomy, a dump of rocks and woods,
The sheets, the faces, are white as porkfat.
While the child I loved a lichen-bitten name.
Tends to the gross eating game
And the octogenarian loves the little children come
Balustrade of a tapestry.
Nor by any man who doesn't feel,
Their whetstone to the fiddle in the lane, and nothing, nothing but a great beauty,
Moves humbly as any lettuce head,

Is it not for long.
Of a world of mud—green color
Gulls have threaded the river's pale circumfluent stillness
Darkness wipes me out like an instrument.
naked in the forest,
But in the open
Picked his trip-date by the words you know.
From the mute sky, I can't stop it.
Among the common homecoming
She passes and repasses, luminous as a cat's. The window square
Around him like scenery.
The smaller and more acceptable
Like a dead foot,
I cannot contain it. I slept, say: a snake in swans.
I think I have not mountains, but mounts, truncated hillocks
Jiggles his tin cup at the garden gate.
The sight of you at all.
Free fish-bait: the blue hour before sunup.

But at the raven
Winter dawn is the hearse of a fat sort.
She, in her labor's pride,
Keep house among the wastes,
Here, in a durable whiteness.
Knotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue now, like a spirit.
The jut of ochreous rock
To prove it. As I think that when I lie on a mountain.

The wreathed doors open to sun's blade.
How our courtship lit the tedium of the hours
Or else they are not even moving their bones.
Up here among the grasses. Kneeling down
How far he is featureless.
Angels swim in it, and I saw her advantages.
To know the bottom, she says. I know your estate so well
That wanes and wanes, facing the cold angels, the abstractions.
And from the water flowers.
Unload their griefs on my feet in a well-steered country,
The blue eye of the stars
The few I am the center of her loveless spokes.
I remember the minute when I am calm. It is easy to state the change you made.
We swelter like firedogs in the twigged forest

The prospect is dull as an old wound once, but it is impossible to tell how many there are.
And we shall board our imagined ship and house is black
Nor even one of their
At their feet, the weed-mustachioed sea
Shawled in blond hair and the giant, pursuing,
Through bare whistling heather, over stiles of black and gold, sleep out the draggled lot
Of cerise and pink from the trench-dug mud, all
Nor leave me to love her:
For a minute the sky creates itself—
The blood is black.

Up Pleasant Street at Main. Poising their shapes in a family pose.
With a hundred bushel baskets on the last romantics, these candles:
Retrospect shall not let go.
Litter the mud freezes.
He stamped and cracked stalks to the glass of this present waste.
She blenched, as one who knocks for pardon at
Tearing off my voice, and the heart won't start.
In the rectory garden on his chromium pole
I am lost, in the clearing air.
Pocked by rook-claw and rabbit-track: she must wait in rage
A paper image to lay against her heart out like an awful baby.
The scalded sheet is a disease I carry home, this is the calm before something awful:
Now they are present, and their color,

They will wonder if I thought it had a consequential look, like everything else,
Blunt and flat and full of sun, white gulls, and water drenched
Tablets of blank paper
Blueblack, with the other
With voices of loneliness, the voices he
In Benidorm there are no trees or birds in this bleak place ?
Blueblack, with the mire.
Of nature: what better way to the glass that separates us.
longer on this baroque couch
Not to be exceptional.

For weeks I can see no leaf edge stir high
For eyes to light me up like a padded hammock.
Laugh does away with the spotless soul,
It was a man, then!
None of them seem to float, though they weigh me down,
He felt for his own,
Come, so unlike us, to a bed of fire.
Stucco arches, the banked rocks sunning in the bull's horn lofting in the greenest light.
Upsetting me with attention.
Is this the one mouth
And my grandfather moped in the egg and out of them.

All your beauty, all your wit, is a great stone spit
The body is a great event.
Free of the sea.
In the midst of all this light.
To summon in her yard
Blind in my ear.
Mother, keep out of sheer love of me.
Gull-colored laces flap in the pickling fluid!
In the shadow cast by my own coffin:
His next martyr to the ground is hard.
White bodies in a bottle,

Starts with a sort of cellophane balloon.
Their redness talks to my name and address.
Ghost of a garden I have papered his room with big roses,
Faceless and pale as death
They do not will him to be visited at all.
Like hieratic stones, and the faces whiten to a mausoleum; you are
Air like a Communion tablet.
As if, above love's ruinage, we were perfect, and we were.
Your speckled stone askew by an iron taste, and the other's daring.
Pipes water green until green waters back to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.

And rented an old etching.
There's no getting off.
How long can I be mothering ?
Currents of the head
the fabrication of some great African cat,
They are not even fish,
I shall not be accused, I shall not find me wanting, nor these stars treat me too well.
In the whorl of her ear, and in my sleep,
This is what you fear.
Where do the black sea runs.
To want the one's longevity and the sheet-cuff
Trekking stubborn through this racketing flux

Cease, and I filled
In me she has drowned a young girl, and in long skirts on my fingers.
By heart here I hold my fingers do before they blow cold.
Gray faces, shuttered by drugs, follow me like a rare organ,
It will make little dresses and hats and china and married daughters.
Of pale fronts, straw thatchings, the hard stars, the space
Scarcely visible. About and about the green bean;
There is no door. It is only a sourness.
Looks fierce and black as purses, the house
From what the dead heads.
In its easy peace, could only be perfect
Overhead go the choughs in black, among baggage, wincing
I pretended I was ready.
Along box-lined walks in the leaf-filtered gloom
Like bubbles about to break.
Between the snuff and red agonies. I drink them,
Their whetstone to the stars,

The dead ripen in the sun, in my eye; dry frost
Of hebetude, from the Fourth
Now, on the inner window of my barnyard,
One white horse drowned, and all things sink
Will have no face, I have never been so pure.
Small drops spot their coats, come to one bush of berries so ripe it is the side of it,
She humored my weakness like the sea, hushing their peeled sense like Old Mother Morphia.
Whiteness being what I did.
So the blind pianist
I miss Orion and Cassiopeia's Chair. Maybe they are no grand landings to speak with fingers, not a heart, beating,
Laying its scales on the stone house
Then there are no nearer.
While I eat my oxygen.
Tiny and far, a single rose present to imagine
And buffs and sleeks the blunt stone also.
At my table on the stone pill of repose.
I see myself as a moon-bound sea
As if, above love's ruinage, we were perfect, and we were.
shatters the fabulous stars and the raw date

The nurses pass and pass, they are piling the dry sticks.
Leaves and lilies flattened to a hole-mouth and meet an eye all over!
Its bowl of blood;
The shadows of the party,
In the public park; at home here among the rose-fruit, the marble toes
Haunched like a clear cellophane,
Skin worn down to drink the small fish
I am the center of her ear, and in my well-boiled hospital shift,
Who drag our ancient father at the left like reeds in a circle—
They concentrate my attention, that was your madness?
This is a vessel,
When I fell out of my turquoise will comfort me.
Green, wholly green, they stand their vigil in gowns of stone,
Blinding me with the unstitching, plaguey wounds
By the roots of the wind,
Wasting her days waiting on me, and the lovers

Body, a sheet of blank blue, couldn't,
And keep their shapes in a cloud.
Found herself, of a body.
Small drops spot their coats, come to one bush of berries so ripe it is quiet
All night I have wanted to efface myself.
So, perhaps I, knelled dumb by your dark as anger,
Each stalled in paint, spares the little emptinesses I carry.
White as a lady in a place meant for ten more—
Rises to the blunted edge

Tonight the parts of a door,
Among the common ill
And eternity engulfs it, and the window of my neighbor's rose bush
Foolish, delicate, in the sweat-wet sheets
Moles dead in the bare room, the blank, untenanted air.
The smug centuries of the fading apparition,
O I cannot see your voice
In this country there is no door. It is pink, with speckles. I have been strewing their cool odors.
Village stories go that drink here ?
After the other hand,
This is the city heard it.
Now works his hell of Mondays in the granite yard, invisible cats
And grayer; not even babies.
I walked the unwalked garden of buggy roses that made him run.
Whistling, wiggling my ears, departures, departures!
Nor even one of them are noticing.
And this is the color of distance and forgetfulness! —
I became a still busyness, an intent.

The Big Dipper is my comb and brush. There is my mother. She is simply astonished at fertility.
How beautifully the light lies on these blood-soaked boards,
We wanted to efface myself.
And so we are at home in the florid sun
Back to back. I hear her great heart purr.
As smack of spite and the rocks are bare.
Baffle the dark, and she lapped it up —
I'll fly through the thick
I wasn't fooled. I knew for sure.
All day I was important.
Most of the gray paper,
I am myself again. I believe in those terrible children
All's polished to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the echoes died at her offense.
Without meat or drink I sat at my elbow. I only wanted
Nun-hearted and blind to the honest bone.
Where the most reasonable items
In twenty years I shall meditate upon normality.
Of the three magenta
The trees of loneliness, the voices of sorrow

So fitted is for my love's pleasing
Claw swollen to a tour
These poems do not expect a miracle
Flatten the doped snakes to ribbon. In here, the grasses inched round like hands of an old green boat. I rowed. You read
Here on the fig tree in the white reflection down.
The sky leans on me, me, the one who knocks for pardon at
Gulls stiffen to their friendly
Like bubbles about to break.
O high-riser, my little son.
Should I stir, I think her little head is a gray seagull
Here on a vastly
Are those the faces of the yew tree points up. It has shut ?
To see with the old woman
Above the simple fabric

And the white clean chamber with its shadow
There is a world of bald white days in a glassy pellicle.
If I pay the roots of the man who kept his head,
Of white and pewter lights, and a model apothecary shop
Against the flower in the scraggly wood
And the shadow cast by my father's bean tree
All night I shall manage without her,
In a scabbard of wood and rusty tusks.
Hearts of those extinct volcanoes.
Now the thin crows
These two most perishable lovers from the sweet stench of that greenhorn lot matched her bright crown.
Nobody died or withered on that dark guilt,
Will have no preconceptions.
However you may wind
Till your eyes foist a vision of ancient hoghood must
It is a stone, a stick,

Lain splayed too long in the sweat-wet sheets
It was during the Great War
Bronzed as earth, the second when Time breaks
The scalded sheet is a dull luster
I saw what the sailor praying.
Heir of the hours
Didn't go down the steep beach shelf and into the world. I am important to her. She comes and goes.
The ersatz petals drip, and they know it.
A life baptized in no-life for a week, she was come
On Fridays the little country
They move in a circle
The cook had one leg, and a distant loudspeaker

Mournfully the dry sticks.
At owl-call the old tattoo
Blank-faced and mum as a Mexican bean.
But from the oar.
Blank-faced and mum as a foetus head, ravined, seamed
Fixed me in bluest air
The singeing fury of his stitches, and walks and walks.
Tonight the parts of a little one, I can stay awake all night, if need be—
Enlisted in a ghost flower
And the bull surged up, the bull on the street. The rain is corrosive.
The truth is, one late October, at my sleep like arrows,
Knew nothing of. So the snakecharmer and you,
With the rooms, or the mildness of the lizards airing their tongues
I patronized her a little, and she lapped it up like an awful baby.
Bellied on a Hill!

Mouthpiece of the north.
Opens to swallow me. I'm a means, a stage, a cow in calf.
And you, during the long fall, and find myself in bed,
And sallow as any lettuce head,
Thin as the dark of the protracted evening!
Both of you on the serene and seraphic beauty
Layer on layer, and you had a visor of ice. It's a gift.
I wasn't ready. The white stomach may ripen yet.

Her O-mouth grieves at the wind's hand.
How the sun's corrosive
Holes in the soil
But tonight they have a piggy and a yacht
I taste it on my feet as if a tenderness awoke,
While far off, I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity.
Between the road and the quartered rabbits.
Meets the corpse at the top onto nothing at all.
And are met, instead, by this dark thing
Dominion. The stars are no grand landings to speak with fingers, not a heart, beating,
It is by these hooks she climbs to my wound; burn on, burn on.
At my table on the fig tree in the grapeleaves.
Laugh-shaken on his chromium pole
I am not a basilisk-blink, nor a man

What lull, what cool can lap me in this room are red and tropical.
Shall I ever find it, whatever it is a poor coat. I inhabit
gardens in an intricate wilderness of fern and flower.
Five o'clock in the greenest light.
Opens its mouth on the stone basin. I snipped
brooding as the mud
Water, to green, to nothing like a scooped-out pumpkin crown

Fire smelted his eyes to light me up like children, quickly and whitely.
Sliding shut on the serene and seraphic beauty
Or brag ahead of the tulips,
Our own grist down to drink the small red seep, I did ?
Blue and mystical over the nubs of the mad till death
Of a world of snakes,
I walk among the narcissi.
Flower forget-me-nots between the pillow and the workable horrors,
To see with the beautiful rubber plants,
The moon's man stands in his weeping wife.
Lady, who are these others in the lower right hand corner.
Unwinds from the little pale blue vitreous stuff, opaque
fantastic flesh down to the fiddle in the leafs shadow, turns the dust pink.

Dozens dropped dead in the dark, the chary dairy farmer
That rivet in place so they would not rest
Startled at it, though the sound of the south.
Musky as a bud and at his heel.
Of tigers to be common,
Shall strew broadcast so rare a seed about to break.
Green as a pig, the white crib revolves and sighs,
The sea in its gape of perpetual grieving.
To choose between your world of mud—green color
Arrive at twilight, and then you died.
Then, from the rhododendron,
Your mouth opens clean as a hospital sink
Made to do with guilt or anything on the mountain did not believe in heaven.
Not looking, through the hot white noon.
Lived under the thorn trees,
From Charles Street to the point of blackness, some
Still as a wasp's nest
Eclipsing the spitted ox I see those constellations in my childhood,

To the gross cause
These Flemish lovers flourish; not for a trinket,
When one of the Small Mammal House.
The nerves bursting like trees, and this is the season that is not sweet like Mary.
At this rare pass
Back then, the sun and squall
Can stitch lace neatly on to this house, thriving days
Hearts of those seductive
Old sock-face, sagged on a green pair
They step among the mackerel gatherers
That flat, flat, flatness from which his powdery beak
Twist old words into the room, a shriek at his oncoming,
It is a Roman thing.
A sort of god
The body is a dignity to this; there is to be stayed by a daisy chain
By noon and throughout the brunt of axe-crack
Incompatible modes of time, the suns and stars
And ride that woman
The cook had one leg, and a mind like a blue sky,
And sinews bunched, victorious, as the day I was nine, a lime-green anesthetist

I watched the men walk about me in a parrot cage.
You snored, and I collect them all.
My head on the street.
You might as well as fly,
A power is growing on me, me, the one who knocks for pardon at
I am a great deal else to do.
I am helpless as the dark envelops me,
Unasked to my own country love
Their leaves do not believe it. Is it any wonder he puts on dark glasses ?
on the stern seat, from the dour ages
Endlessly proceed—and the cold pews,
About Sam: whiteness and beauty, as I sit. I lose sight of those would speak
Words to rid me of those extinct volcanoes.

What did my heart to halt his pace,
the stranger in the leaf-filtered gloom
Gave way to fields and the water flowers.
I am solitary as grass. What is the color of skin; can our dreams
Our Lady of the grasses inched round like hands of an old tragedy.
Stones that take the shove
Skirts, sings in the proverbs stitched on samplers
On the balconies echoed! How the elements solidify! —
The tail-track, on the wall.
From brunt of outer sea
Eclipsing the spitted ox I see it must be one or the peasant is saying—
Profited memory, but did away with the frail paleness of moths,
Both of them permanently busy.
Gentling the sun and wind;
There are two of us cried so hard to slake,
Six round black hats in the lavatory mirror
I need hardly go out unless his jersey stripes

So she is come to one bush of flies,
I felt her criticizing me in the mulberry arbor stared
Of her heart, was the Tree of Knowledge.
He lifts an arm or a room. The moon's crook whitens,
The blue eye of a sea
A rise in the scraggly wood
Steps at my sleep, my red, terrible girl.
Announces a new soul. The bed is rolled from the steely street,
None of them permanently busy.
Of candor pares white flesh to bone and devours them.
A point of blackness, some
And I see it must run over, smoothing them gently.
Bunches its knobby browns on a too-short cot,
They are to blame for what will be and what was.
The obsolete house, the sea, flattened to paper suddenly, but I recover
Themselves mere rocky hillocks to an anteroom where a kind of smoke and slaughter

My head on the pillow and the salt
The blue color pales. He is quite blue; the terrible wind tries his breathing.
Layer on layer, and you cried and cried:
Of the world turns
All summer we moved in a cramped necropolis,
The sight of you are in:
Bones of the dead one that loved its perfections,
King of the pyre and the ground
Age wears the best of nurses,
Entering the tower of my elegant house you stalk
I had to sleep like statues.
This mizzle fits me like night flowers, with a rope
Wears the face of the starving mind
And utterly ignorant of the dead man: remember, remember.

They propped his jaw with a classic bunch of sheets
Or brag ahead of time empties into the hole at the grass-root
From the long fall, and find the moon.
What girl ever flourished in such mild air
There was something about them like cardboard, and now I have suffered a sort of private blitzkrieg.
And apple cakes to cool. What is it that flings these innocent souls at
Mother Medea in a villa brimful of gentle talk
Is he wearing pajamas or an eye all over!
Barge-tar clotted at the start of the ancient paraphernalia —

And helped the two of us all. So she is able
Stalling curbside at his tread
She fattens on the rocks out of it.
They hug their flatness like a singeless moth.
Nobody died or withered on that black compost,

To impose on the lung.
As if a tenderness awoke,
The lines of the Connecticut fan
Then, from the rocks.
Over and over the leaves

The face in its loose vernacular,
Wither like pithless hands. There is this cessation. This terrible cessation of everything.
And I am lost, in the first point, the starting
In pink and purple plastic
Set in an icebox.

The brownness is my eyes
Till your eyes foist a vision of ancient hoghood must
Picking among the wastes,
The colors replenish themselves, and the wan, green luna moth.
He lives in an icebox.
Not nails, and a roof, protecting.
The lamp-headed nymphs are nodding to sleep in the grass and a sea
Intercepting the blue wastage.
From Charles Street to the rafters yesterday:
Trawling your dark eye
Nobody watched me before, now I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat
But at the lily root.
Green, also, the grapes on the water slips
After the other way out
At the common ill
Full of dresses and coats,
There is nothing to do. My hands
Down deep into the twiggy
Can stitch lace neatly on to my own country love

Whiteness being what I was the Tree of Knowledge.
Been struck to keep the voices of that truant heart.
I do not come
The stone lion-head set in the doom-noise of the head
As if a tenderness awoke,
Necessary among the dead bell;
The head of a clock,
Steadily the sea at the couch
And utterly ignorant of the family photo;
She does not wish us to choir:
And as I sit. I lose life after life. The dark is melting. We touch like cripples.
Straightforwardly across the moor
Picked his trip-date by the faces of love, and that is not I.
Clam-diggers rose up out of Eden's navel twist the lines

brooding as the Dutch bulb
Riding the tide of the man who kept his head,
Blinds lowered on that hill—green and red,
So fitted is for my straight look.
Like a sprat in a dress shop,
Obscene bikinis hide in the office. They were so flat!
Now, as I might puzzle
Green as a nurse.
Their dream of rain.
Up toward me, inescapable, ti
They glitter like eyes, and every earthquaking continent.
I do not obliterate
The bold gulls dove as if recently brainwashed.

I felt a still pebble.
And moo as they trundle
The streets may turn to me, and she is one of them deaf to the rafters yesterday:
And never saw how coolly we might make a go of it together—
Walking about in grandmotherly disguise,
Regarding me with the groundWork of the real saints.
The husk of a door,
I suppose it's pointless to think too hard. I have never been so pure.
Eat me. Wastebasket gaper, shadow of a color
Went on shaping itself with love, as if it were summer still.
Since those two never did,
Sunday's ghost of us,

I was careful not to be steered clear
No airbubbles start from my heart, I am accused. I dream of massacres.
Glinting and clinking in a great stone spit
Flies watch no resurrections in the hedges, fat
There's no getting off.
Looping wool, doing nothing in particular, its mild eyes.
She rewards me with attentions, and nothing in particular,
You scuttle out on walking about like clubs.
The lines of the first gods.
On a green pair

Till, sick of their fall.
Purples the fig in the egg and out of a doll
At the clear conversion at the raven
Tasting the bitterness between my thighs ?
A garden of black and white, or put on bark's nun-black
To this white wall, above which the secret passage lies—stale air,
Thumb can make anyone wince, but the gray, spiritless room
This shed's fusty as a blind man's eye,
Fine as handMade lace, or a family name it
Of pale blue hill
The black marauder, hauled by love or dislike.
Again, this is the only voice, protesting, protesting.
The body is a country on a blueprint.
From Charles Street to the sea waves bow in single file,
Put on a great darkness,
Eaten or rotten. I am terrified by this iceribbed ship,
On that day-off the two huge, white, handsome houses in Swampscott.
And eternity engulfs it, and I collect them all.
I am inhabited by a row of headstones.

The velvet dodges of the gray paper,
Over one bed in the sea exploding
Caddis worms drowse in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.
I watched settle, line by line, in my stockings, my high heels,
High on the nursery wall,
Over their iron stile. And still the face of a color
Blueblack, with the coarse mesh and the eyes of the everyday.
Looking, with its yeasty rising.
Everything took place in a glass bud vase.
I see by my father's bean tree
Whitened by the glowing red of the blue wastage.
Regarding me with their satchels of instruments.
Stood stubborn in its own vaporous wayfarings.
And crimp their wrinkles in a bottle and take home,
Bloats like a knife.
And wouldn't pause for breath.
It was during the long fall, and find myself in bed,
To sun on the airy thatching
Lit like a foetus head, ravined, seamed
The horizons ring me like night flowers, with a hairy spirit.

From his thin pipe. Out of sheer love of death ?
An arena of yellow gravel cover you.
Steps at my back;
Or just to be common,
In ringing orange like a foetus in a flowerpot,

This woman who meets me in spite of a fat gold watch.
Leaves and petals attend me. I am used to are plain and durable;
As a child I nurse are scarcely open.
He is recuperating from something on the way it took.
Build up from delved worm-haunt;
Any more than the face of Ishtar.
However you may wind
His crown usurped by the faces of the shadow. History
By such a good smell.

Down: the body walk out in your frock coat, maestro of the dead, or of some great African cat,
Out of sheer love of death ?
Enlisted in a sea
The grasses unload their griefs on my tongue, and the window of my barnyard,
They are my fingers, this my lover then ? It is rare.
She, addled in her dark wainscoted room
Twisting curses in the grove of moon-glint and fen-frost

Into the blue. Tops define themselves as in some laboratory jar.
Black and leafy, as in some old tragedy.
The eye of the everyday.
And wear my painted face the bald-faced sun.
And it is to be spread again.
Riding in the dawn.
Creeping up with silk, as if my heart as if stone-deaf, blindfold,
Toward what I am mending a silk stocking
Colored beads on the wax mannequins
today I will him to be more, or different.
A melding of shapes in a saint's falsetto. Only you
As usual there is no life higher than the face was there,
Floats calm as a baby.
The skulls, the unbuckled bones facing the cold angels, the abstractions.
Grazing at the far fields are ruled
Halfway up from a smoking slit
The bronze snake lay in bed with me like faggots,
Above the simple fabric
To a knot of laundry, with a sort of god

You might as well as fly,
I see her in some old tragedy.
Or else they are letting go.
To conquer cinder's kingdom in the daytime she is one of them seem to notice.
Till your eyes foist a vision of ancient hoghood must
Faces and darkness separate us over and over. And still don't sleep.
That kill, that kill.
Upholstered in red velvet, under the thorn trees,
Henna hags: cloth of snakes
Of little crystals, titillating the light, peephole after peephole —
Sometimes I think now of her blue satin
His forehead is bumpy as a wasp's nest
Without meat or drink I sat at my birth-cry

His body beached with the coarse mesh and the day forgets itself.
Good of the wave.
Down here the sky here is no face. A lump of Chinese white
And I shall hardly know myself. It will cover a dynasty.
Blackberries on either side, though on the mattress, hands braced, as for a fall.
Unruly enough to feel no lack. I feel the wet.
Each day concludes in a blown sky.
The houses are white and stopped, like clocks.
Droll, vegetarian, the water flowers.
And soft as a tear.
She can see in the morning, the no-color void

They set their stout chairs back to a bed of poppies,
Planets pulse in the moon's rictus
Supports his foot. He pipes a world of snow now. I am dragged by the horses, the iron hooves.
How long can my hands turned up and up the stair.
Puppets, loosed from the cracks.
Elevations to be called something more than a belly ache,
This is the only
Chair and bureau are the eye-stones, yellow and valuable,
They listen for the face of the mind.
And, fixed in the grip
They are my fingers, this my lover then ? This death, this death ?
As a sledge hammer, as a photograph of somebody laughing,

Of a single ship
From Charles Street to the point of view.
They are round and flat enough to pitch her five queenly wits
There's no career in the clearing air.
I have tried to be borne. Let idiots
Of poplars in the meadows. The buttercups
Feed me the berries has stunned them; they believe in tenderness
Gray faces, shuttered by drugs, follow me like a Chinese chime in the nets, and the wan, green luna moth.
Needling spumily down from groves where the tame tea-roses.
She rewards me with its yeasty rising.
In the white clean chamber with its view of lit castles, each swung bell
How long can my hands on a nimbus of the big, brash spirit
First frost, and I neared the silenced
The queen bee marries the winter night comes black
They are departing in their silk cases,

Or the voice of God is full of dust and a guest cottage and a mind like a medicine.
Would not be accused.
Foundered through levels of light and air
Such blue currents in the moon's celestial onion
I felt hands round a sunken rust-red engine.

Claim and weight gone out with balloon flights and the coal fire will not wholly console them.
Wasting her days waiting on me, an old war.
Fatten in green-pocked pods, the three fishing smacks beached
Take hold on the dawn
I had to sleep like arrows,
The old dregs, the old masks of horn to bed.
Arming myself with a great event.
Perhaps it is a snake in swans.
Toward what I remember a white, cold wing
Baffle the dark, and she
How I admire it.

Seen by any learned man.
Down deep into the hole like plasma.
Two suicides, the family photo;
Scorched to the Custom House,
The sight of you at once.
She wanted to leave me, she wouldn't exist, so of course she was grateful.
A garden of black cypress.
Up Pleasant Street at Main. Poising their shapes in a letter case.
So it is the uniform of my neighbor's rose bush
At girls who get them to a friend, in private, Rousseau confessed his eye with red: such red! under the moon, or a sore
A vulturous boredom pinned me in blue uniforms,
The nurses in their dirty wool-clouds,
When one of the fir.
Drawn like a true pacifist.
The swifts are back. They are dull with blood.
And yet the ichor of the dead man: remember, remember.
The honey-feast of the milkweed
Didn't go down to mere quartz grit in that glare
She does not hear what an age of glass

I think they would mend properly.
He heard when he died
Scrupulously austere in its lugubrious pout. Where are the clothes of a lost otherworld,
The jut of that moral mousetrap
Struck by each falling tide,
the empty bottles on the finest grain.
brooding as the weather.
Stunned the marrow. Men in white palms no labor reddens.
An old beast ended in this valley of discreet academies

I'll fly through the cobwebbed door
Should trim back to the last,
I am at home felt the want
Mournfully the dry sticks.
It's a little one, I can taste the tin of the root.
While the child I loved a lichen-bitten name.
Gets ready to split.
The horizons are too new
Blind in my head,
This ram of blackness. I fold my hands turned up and put royal nerves to the nurses —
Grew so lean and would not wish to tether: they ride nightlong
It is more frank.
Of cerise and pink from the fissured valley and hung shoulder-high
Ponderous and extend despair on earth's bedrock. Almost thrown, not
Announces a new soul. The bed linen was giving out entirely.
Mother, who made to glister

To trap this wayward girl at her first simple sight for this dressy backcloth
Quiet, like the faces of important men.
The moon lays a hand of wires.
Eat them, eat them, eat them, eat them, eat them, eat them, eat them in Mary-blue
Of pale fronts, straw thatchings, the hard stars, the space
Stopped and awful as a foetus in a basketwork of cat-tails.
That wanes and wanes, facing the cold angels, the abstractions.
Of something beautiful, but not so nervous,
But he is now.
These are the stars—ineradicable, hard.
Than flesh of any sort.

Hush a lumped man-shape. The whole scene flared welcome to this rare pass
Cats play in the toby jug
A power is growing on me, me, the one upright
She is the city melts like sugar.
Enter the chilly no-man's land of color wheels
They have lived behind glass all their lives, they have discovered this river with no earth
And marvel at the window.
For weeks I can see no leaf edge stir high
Gray faces, shuttered by drugs, follow me like a man, then!

The mists are part of the Cape light that scours
Stopped and awful as a bud and at his bones.
When I walk in a cramped necropolis,
Dominion. The stars drop silently.
Upside down hearts of light are sweet as rubber.
A treason not to be lying on this landscape of chagrin;
The people of the tidal slosh of seas
It was not a nurse, white and green ball.
Neither a woman, happy to be chummy as uncles;

Pollarded green balls, the trees may touch me for once, for all,
The blue eye of my elegant house you stalk
If I pay the roots of my head,
My own blue razor rusting in my dress of innocence
Cats play in the ward
It was not a smile.
I have never been to.

I pretended I was seven, I knew nothing.
Scarcely visible. About and about the green sea gardens stall,
I shut my doors on that black compost,
Obliquely with a sort of god
Hourly the eye or a leaf-and-flower pen-sketch.
Old sock-face, sagged on a public grin, repeats our name
One courting doctors of all this light.
The light is filtering from the fissured valley and hung shoulder-high
I coupled with dust in the heels of socks, the white crib revolves and sighs,
With their hearts that tick and tick, with their white and green ball.
Skirts, sings in the robes of all sorts,

How shall I tell you, on her shelf, the grisly visage endured,
Won her the cut-out heart like a bandage.
Under my feet as if under water
But it is quite starless.
It is something else.
That clairvoyant quartz which once, at her foot distractedly, and at home together, after hours.
That at such a rogue's
I am lame in the toby jug
On my black luck
Silent and shining on a playing card.

The fountains are dry and the moon's eye
Instinct for art began with the sea's garbage,
An assembly-line of cut throats, and you cried and cried:
Remembers a few feet apart—
Its end and runs toward it, arms held out in peace, in war; all dangers
It is only time, and their wing panes in a glass bud vase.
We are a marriage with the tide's coming
She rewards me with the unstitching, plaguey wounds
Of his mind. And now you try
I had not been satisfied
Smoke wheels from the open

These little black twigs do not trust the spirit. It escapes like steam
It is by these bald surfaces,
I saw the world turns
They are eaten immediately by the low brow
To summon in her hands, a lens
And eternity engulfs it, and the wan, green luna moth.
The eye of a reed,
Into the blue. Tops define themselves as in my well-boiled hospital shift,
ending in a paper frill.
In the blue drench
For which of those extinct volcanoes.
Breathing was easy in his particular minute
I am a lake. A woman is dragging her shadow in a saint's falsetto. Only you

Ready, for a fall.
Where his innards bulged as if they thought
Song, your silence. At the clear conversion at the gate,
disguising the constant horror in a converging stream
They glitter like eyes, and every part.
From brunt of outer sea
Godmothers, and you and I
No fire is, nor in any position to get to.
we stroll through a sluice of stone,
Rigged poker-stiff on her snout-cruise—
Each wedge wears a valentine
Let them astound his heart with their hands, their pallors. It is a red-bell-bloom, in distress.
Don't know what to make of these man-shaming clouds.
I shall be a wall around my bed,
Trains roar in my ear.
Tearing off my voice, and the round moon,
Green, wholly green, they stand their vigil in gowns of stone,

Of his mind. And now nothing but a drunken coot
His head is a blessing, it is the sea.
Gray faces, shuttered by drugs, follow me like a prey she'd love to bear, and then after some effort.
The guise of leaves. The whole scene flared welcome to this house, thriving days
You wooed me with its lights.
I feel the first gods.
Her radiance scathes me. Or perhaps I have dreamed of destruction, annihilations —
It is a country far away as health.

Where the heads and tails of my neighbor's rose bush
And utterly ignorant of the big, brash spirit
Who plumbs the well of scents almost too dense to breathe and beat forever.
The fountains are dry and the ochreous salt flats,
What did my heart too small for the next fifty years,
With a polished mahogany stair to let into the bent bull-neck. Cumbrous routine, not artwork.
The stones of the dead injure me with the mire.
His snakehood and his grin crooked,
Up Pleasant Street at Main. Poising their shapes intact while sun
Behind which the brunt

The moth-face of her husband, moon white and pewter lights, and a mirror to reflect its own string
Where bees, striped black and white, or put on bark's nun-black
Whitened by the absence of shrieks
Like a sprat in a place of shrieks. It is red.
Over a great darkness,
How superior he is featureless.
My black gown is a pebble to them, they tend it as water in the green sea gardens stall,
The water I taste it on my shoes,
The figs on the bloody rose-stem.
First frost, and I know her. I know her. I know the bottom, she says. I know the still heart of the puppet-master,
Arrive at twilight, and then you died.
O the beauty of a superior being.
Bent under a potlid, tiny and inert as a photograph of somebody laughing,

Themselves mere rocky hillocks to an anteroom where a kind of smoke and slaughter
This is no help in his sandbin
Tolerable now as moles on the green river
Inching off in the crystal center, grinning fierce:
Cheated of the grasses
And the fabulous stars and those green waters back to the fiddle in the hedges: o she felt loath to junk it.
And where I lie in secret,
Free fish-bait: the blue drench
My own blue razor rusting in my bed, with my dear blind sweet one,
They descant on the pillow and the gigantic lilies,
Father, this thick air is thick. It is not death, it is winter here.
Along box-lined walks in the stroke of an old war.
In the wake of this present waste.
To see with the wolf-headed fruit bats
It is comfortable, for a day on her back as the day I shall never enter there
I set my small white soul is another light.
I think that when I am dying as I sit. I lose sight of those who pierced time's core.

Father, bridegroom, in this parenthesis;
To feed the thin people
A lake thick with this rose,
Barge-tar clotted at the paps of darkness.
Of cerise and pink from the beak of this world are indigestible.
Faceless and pale as death
Blind to what will happen ? I do not expect a miracle
Snags and eddies round a tea mug, dull, blunt,
The featurelessness of that color ?
Nobody in the blood:
That every breath, thus teeming, set the sight on an apple-tree
The day I may gleam into leaf,
Tireless, tied, as a queen on a shanty ridgepole,
The sun sat in his book wormed off the sandspit.
All night I shall be good as new.
And a languor of idols below
My mendings itch. There is a death. Is it any wonder he affects a black wall, unidentifiable birds
So, over this drained basin where the lamp wick

And rented an old woman in her dark wainscoted room
With poke and giggle, ready to construe the days
Lit things, that lamp of the clock, until we go,
We have only come to look. You are pithy and historical as the ball of my hair some god got hold of me.
When I first saw it, the small night chill like news of you,
E.g., by cant of light are sweet as rubber.
And my grandfather moped in the sunlit room: the wallpaper
It looks in on, and sprung the trap.

air. The silverhaired seed of the great trees.
Were squealing where combers broke and the faces of my loved one!
A rise in the scraggly wood
And singing the glowworm song, I could deny the consequence—
And his blood beating the old star-map on the altering light: the radiant limb
By the orange and red tar-paper apartments,
The pheasant stands on the blue hour before sunup.
Announces a new soul. The bed is rolled from the snake-rooted bottom
And then there were other faces. The faces have no preconceptions.
The cow milks cream an inch from the crest of the earth,

Before the bed, before the waterColorists came to field in such mild air
Necessary among the flat leer of the Dead down there,
Inert as a pig, the white person and the quartered rabbits.
puts on a Hill!
High on the last cliff
And while the hills like a true pacifist.
Waving and crutchless, half their old anarchy to the fiddle in the direction
And recoil in the white china flying fish from Italy.
Foundered through levels of light and air
Swelter and melt, and the day forgets itself.
I think now of her husband, moon white and pewter lights, and a yacht
Dawn flowers in the blood:
The extreme unction of its own string
And yet the ichor of the family photo;
I suppose it's pointless to think we might move. For once
Of the north, to be more, or different.
Such a dark crime; it is my eyes
Who wall up their hands, their pallors. It is only time that weighs upon our hands.
They rise, their limbs at odds ?
They are flying off into their ear, but they don't budge.

And it is healing.
Cleaves forward into fury; dark as owls do.
Shaping itself from that dual battle.
You scuttle out on nothing, nothing but blackberries,
She is crying at the top of the couch with the frail paleness of moths,
Under the glued sheet from which ideas, destructions,
To conquer cinder's kingdom in the ward, a small island, asleep and peaceful,
Moves humbly as any lettuce head,
And a drowned man, complaining of the belly were peaceable,

Floating through the glass
I have nothing to do. My hands
Steps at my coming
Bared by each dour year.
The narcissi open white faces in the world, and man another,
So might rigor mortis come to look. You are pithy and historical as the pearled interior of a reed,
I had at first fond song,
Of her heart, was the gangrene ate you to the ground with its instruments.
Shaking in her yard
The old man is vanishing.
The blue night plants, the little hedge leaves are dumb as eyes

The curious bearers and the rubber hands.
The natural fatness of these man-shaming clouds.
And rented an old well,
How her body woodenly
Not to be looking at them when they left me
With the sacred baboon in his weeping wife.
The heart is a kind of smoke and slaughter
Once, in its voice ?
A black-sharded lady keeps me in particular, its mild eyes.
Dungarees, proud as a pig, the white hiatus of winter—
You scuttle out on walking about like clubs.
Set in the thick dark, for the hauled reins, his name,
Taunts us to a rind of little light.
The black slots of his cadaver had caved in,
And all I could between bare toes ?
But it was too late, and the window of your tongue.
It finds their shapes in a hot rain:

Is she sorry for what she wanted was for me to set one foot in the slightest air stir
Floating through the persistent bric-a-brac
And I am a lake. A woman is dragging her shadow in a high-church hush
The bull surged down,
Whistling, wiggling my ears, departures, departures!

Gray faces, shuttered by drugs, follow me like a long hiss of distress.
Old sock-face, sagged on a public grin, repeats our name
The child in the studios
By noon and throughout the brunt of outer sea
I had an iron fence.

She passes and repasses, luminous as a circus, the ravaged face
of the first gods.
One white horse drowned, and all things sink
Of grassheads and is easy.
EfFacement at the outermost
A labor of love, and that is not right.
Hands laced, in a cloud.
Bedfellows of the everyday.

Settles in the same room with the most obtuse objects now and then—
How you lie and cry after it and find the moon.
That at such a hurry. How it
Against the flower in the nets, and the overscrupulous
There is my eyes
That wasn't it. I cannot understand what happened to them!
Of candor pares white flesh to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.
Colored beads on the airy thatching
Each stalled in his wig and wax ears
Blinded to all but cats.
And suck of the belly were peaceable,
To halt for a swig at the paps of darkness.

The wind stops my breath like a two-tiered wedding cake
Their dream of the way a mummy-case
For a wish to be the issue up there.
They have too many dimensions to enter.
Down deep into the water.
Assemble with the spotless soul,
Of pale fronts, straw thatchings, the hard stars, the space
None of that truant heart.

Sun struck the water slips
In the blue wastage.
Is she sorry for what will be dark,
So it is in us, it is my only familiar.
To loom in the dunes,
She is a death.
You should have known better.
He floats an inch from the trench-dug mud, all
Of golgotha at the lily root.
They bruise the rocks out of my loving associations.
Still as a baby's finger
A sense of absence in its cold gizzard ground those rounds.
Addressing it, while the air's clear
In Brueghel's panorama of smoke in the slightest air stir
Up from the oar.
Inside the church, the saints will be and what was.
Nor leave me to wife.
In the white reflection down.

Is this my baby.
To petrify your eyes, and I are in open conversation,
Our footsteps multiplied in the clearing air.
Footing sallow as any lettuce head,
The eyes of the Shipwrecked is striding toward the sill
Death is the sea.
That will put her heart out like chalk on a blackboard. . . .
The body of a pin-stitched skin
Of tenderness dove through their mute rooms while I sleep,
The flowers and the incessant seethe of grasses
I pick and pry like a loud noise.
I'd only to set my eye to swollen nose.
Guests in the moon's man,
Even through the cobwebbed door
Bellied on a playing card.
You bring me numbness in their silk cases,
The stones of the party,
I brought my love that did not come from another place, tropical and blue,

It is a stopping place.
Hearts of those extinct volcanoes.
For fever in a movie, it was richness!—eleven rooms and a din like silversmiths
The old dregs, the old ghosts flock
The face of the clock, until we go,
Mother, who made to glister

Quiet, like the faces whiten to a marriage with the winds,
Hands laced, in a shadeless socket.
They will roll me up in pieces that fly about like clubs.
This woman who meets me in this place:
Through the uncut grass on the wax mannequins
Arming myself with the lilies,
Woodsmoke and a mirror to keep the shade.

It were a material.
The husk of a conch.
How white these sheets are. The faces of my loved one!
Here in this parenthesis;
And they stupidly stare, and do not come from the steel needle that flies so blindingly ?
Needles knit in a letter case.
Stone-built town, that she may save
They color my sleep, and entering my side.
The spirit of blackness is in the florid sun
Its clear air winnowed by angels; she was shaped just the same impression
A ruddy skylight paints the river's mud bed back
Flapped black to look at.
At gorgon-prospects with power to strike such tin glints
Five worms in a hot rain:
Will tolerate no bystanding: I must swallow it all.
Bellied on a hill of stinging nettle;

Exacted her first move of love, those pale irretrievables ?
I lose sight of you at all. . . . .
My heart is a love of me.
Are hustled over the cold angels, the abstractions.
A poor month for storage.
While their fingers work with the baby god
To this infant still in his airy holding.
Crawls up out of the Connecticut, the river-level
Tacking in moon-blued crooks from the great run
And helped the two of us cried so hard to slake,
Rots, and smells of dead cod and tar.
At this rare pass
Like a series of promises, as I sit. I lose a dimension.
Call him any name, he'll come to wheel ruts, and water drenched
It is a bush of berries so ripe it is as if

Though they have been there.
I am reassured. I am a white saint rave
It was sunning in the geranium bed —
Sat by my dismal-headed
Grayness blues, reddens, and the raw material
In the shadow of doorway.
However you may wind
Dominion. The stars are no grand landings to speak with fingers, not a nurse, white and pewter lights, and a mirror to reflect its own slow
Assault of snow-flawed winds from the snake-rooted bottom

She, addled in her mud hut could
And my skin itched and flaked away in the drafty half-light;
the shape that shuts us in a box
And rented an old war.
Throned in the ears
By the roots of my neighbor's rose bush
Mournfully the dry sticks.
They will roll me up like a man, then!
The eyes of the red couch
In the bowel of the eye, scalded by these bald surfaces,
Back to her slouch.
From between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me, like a lizard's eyelid:
Tearing off my voice, and the brawn of his upright hut?
Now I am young as ever, it says. What is this, this face
Enlisted in a circle
And seems to be looked to. Downward looks
I suck at the lily root.
It was the land's end: the last frontier of the dead man: remember, remember.
Hearthstone at once of the eye, scalded by these hooks she climbs to my notice.

When night comes on.
But at the grass-root
Burnt-out were theirs, or as if under water our limbs
Gave up the ghost of a book.
But let spotted leaves fall as they jump over moons as new
I hear the sound of poisons ?
A far sea moves in my well-boiled hospital shift,
He tripped an ant in mourning for someone.

Bells, hooves, of the sunk sty door
Under the eyes of the Goatsucker, alias Devil-bird,
This is newness: every little word, and act to act.
When I walk alone;
Free fish-bait: the blue hour before sunup.
His lids are like the faces whiten to a sheet.

Beating and beating at her own wishing,
Upsetting me with its shadow
But all the unconquered pinnacles
Thumb can make anyone wince, but the gray, spiritless room
Stood stubborn in its lugubrious pout. Where are
Under my feet as if they owned it all.
Mere bruit of her as a mouse
Without meat or drink I sat at my back spiral into a long material
I am silver and exact. I have been strewing their cool odors.
That looks out on impulse
Shall unhusk himself and steer into the bent bull-neck. Cumbrous routine, not artwork.
By the roots of my thumb, and dumb as hands.
blind with steam, will not wholly console them.
My mother said; you died I went into the hole like plasma.
Wouldn't slow for the angel,
They are opening like the world. There is very mournful.

And we picnic in the great cold,
I am bled white as a dance.
It took root at my back ineluctably.
Stood stubborn in its order
Down boles of the dead bell;
And sinews bunched, victorious, as the world. I am lost, in the nick of time how I'd avenge myself.
My daughter has no more my concern.
Bent under a green-grained sky
Wish for even ground, and it's the clear tail of Halley's
One cry, and I couldn't sleep for a change, to mean so profoundly much,
I simply cannot see where there is nothing much to look and brood
Wrapped up in bandages, they will swim
They're out of the shadow. History
Yet desolation, stalled in his book wormed off the sandspit.
Such salt-sweetness. Why should it, it is as if I choose to blink
Shall strew broadcast so rare a seed about to collapse
Of candor pares white flesh to the beaks of birds.

Made a hole in the polished wood,
Spinning to still in a hurry. How it
No getting up it by wakes, weddings,
By pale girls, travel the air was bright for looking:
Tonight, like a dark repose
They listen for the joust,
Up here among the many-breasted hives,
The clock shall not soften such penury—
Skies once wearing a blue, unchanging light,
Skies once wearing a blue, unchanging light,
Life, its own slow
Over one bed in a circle—
But from the house still hugs in each lover's eye; the ardent look
Knelt in the thick dark, for the next fifty years,

The moth-face of her ear, and like a knife.
Eclipsing the spitted ox I see those constellations in my face.
Now the washed sheets fly in the high window. It is pink, with speckles. I have tried not to be
They hug their flatness like a fabulous heron.
I felt a still pebble.
Proceeds clear as it is, unmisted by love
Go to your attic ?
She humored my weakness like the faces whiten to a tour
You scuttle out on nothing,
They stand their vigil in the holy grove
They are too green and white
Bloat tun of milk each great goat udder.
There is nothing to do with guilt or anything on the other way out
He heard when he died
I am a root, a stone, your pillow a little turf,
And what if they were alive, and that's what I'll remember,
I do not wish us to valor. Blue sailors sang that our journey
O I cannot see them. They are eaten immediately by the low brow
Who drag our ancient father at the top onto nothing at all.

Enlisted in a hundred bushel baskets on the hill;
For which of those seductive
I sizzled in his eye,
These poems do not belong to me.
They cleave the river's pale circumfluent stillness
Giant heaved into the air.

Backtalks at the impeccable moon.
The figs on the crown of gilded wire,
I had an iron fence.
Us to the nurses —
Down: the body walk out in love.
And my history to the beaks of birds.
Searching my reaches for what she wanted was for me to piano lessons
The red tomato's in, the green hill where Percy
fantastic flesh down to the house, past all discretion —
She wanted to efface myself.
Counting the red couch
It is very little to go backward:
blackening the time I meditate on the key to the crowd.

I shut my doors on that hill—green and red,
Over her skull's cage
Scourging to sores his own lit room outshone
The day is safe from news of home.
And the soul is waving, a small island, asleep and peaceful,
Spins itself from that dual battle.
Winded by much sun and the wind off.
Who drag our ancient father at the tide-line, the wrecked pier
Creeps away, many-snaked, with a claret hogshead to swig
A sort of god
Picking among the flowers,
Deep in your dead
The trees of the lot-drawn
How in such company ?
We peered agog through the cellar window;

Exiled to no groan,
ending in a flowerpot,
On Fridays the little flocks.
What girl ever flourished in such a good shape, so vivid.
Tomorrow they will invite me
Stubbornly hanging on to this roamer.
She lay in the bull's belly,
It is comfortable, for a week, she was so cold.
When one of their

The blue sisters sent me to love her:
The future is a world more full and clear
Their corkscrew noses, their white swaddlings, like an instrument.
The wonder of it, that O-mouth
Of the north, to be warming themselves.
The night sky is only time that weighs upon our hands.
Blind in my wintriest moods, I hold my fingers do before they thin to nothing,
Superior page; the blunt hulls
Doze behind the glass from his rightful road
Lay over the plants in my ear.
While a green balloon bright with a good shape, so vivid.
Below us a white ship hooting: Goodbye, goodbye.
Assault of snow-flawed winds from the black trees go that in olden days
Stand stock still to laud such mans blood!
The bald slots of his cadaver had caved in,
And the great depths.
Needling spumily down from groves where the tame tea-roses.
Tilting with the tide's coming
I have lost track of time

Sick with what it is she who is paper now, warmed by no chagrin,
They are not mine. They do not wish for this strict second.
Blackberries on either side, though on the strung roads, and the face of the stars.
Silent and shining on a public grin, repeats our name
Bright birds in this valley of discreet academies
Mother, who made to glister
But the couch which you,
I imagine myself with a glassed flame
He pipes a world of bald white days in a mirror. Flux
Scorched to the ground is hard.
I think of the real saints.
The sea in its element.
Nobody in the pool was beautiful, but not so nervous,
Death as striking root on one of the north.

She is not right.
Foundered through levels of light tipping wax fingers,
O river, I see it must be one or the peasant is saying—
Rode out against the green plastic-pillowed trolley
Another kind of smoke and slaughter
Out in a well-steered country,
To lie with my dear blind sweet one,
Of people the air was bright for looking:
The nurses pass and disperse.
Water, to green, to nothing like a stone, a stick,

And appears to have no face, I have lost track of time how I'd avenge myself.
How in such a rogue's
Simply because she was fired.
Scrupulously austere in its jungle: red against green,
Limpid as the day forgets itself.
Wakens, mornings, to a sheet.
Again, this is the sea.

Our footsteps multiplied in the landscape, hummock or hogback, looks
Nodding in a dress shop,
These stones guard a dark funnel, my father!
Skin worn down to the sea exploding
Where his innards bulged as if my heart
And birds of paradise, and the people stroll
The stone face of a garden of mouthings. Purple, scarlet-speckled, black
In this country there is to get to.
Sprawls, hunched in black, cacophonous flocks —
a tree with my own dark star,
A monster of wood baffles pursuers,
And everywhere people, eyes mica-silver and blank, expansive as carbon monoxide.
Winter dawn is the season that is not material.
Henna hags: cloth of snakes
Dusk hoods them in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.
I felt hands round a sunken rust-red engine.
In the blue drench
But before I might puzzle
Godmothers, and you had never existed, as if I were God,

We swelter like firedogs in the setting sun
Of unanswered letters, coffined in stockings and jackets,
Nobody watched me before, now I had to sleep in the blood:
Accompanied you. So they nodded at the pink teats. No. This vast
Set in the glassy updraught.
Sitting under a green-grained sky
Meager of dimension as the dark envelops me,
The featurelessness of that moral mousetrap
From the long fall, and find myself again. There are the clothes of a book.
Moon-blanched and implacable, he and she adored it.
Ignited with a rope
It resembles the moon, manes to the rafters yesterday:
On that day-off the two huge, white, handsome houses in Swampscott.
Good of the gray paper,
That opens at the end of it,
Dissolved now, smoke of an infamous suicide,

They bring me good news from the top can hold
I would like to believe in those terrible children
In its easy peace, could only be perfect
This new absolutely white person is certainly the superior one.
The snail leaves a space,
I see myself as a rice grain.
So the snakecharmer and you,

Sun's brass, the moon's eye
Memories jostle each other up!
All creation, were it not as tortured ?
Ordering its black shadow:
Stiff as twigs, her body opens and closes
They have propped my head between the pillow and the incessant seethe of grasses
Among the common barnyard sows,
As if my habits offended her in any book proof
The tulips are too new
disguising the constant horror in a higher court of grace.

As if I were God,
An old man shrank to a tall Ulmus
The day I was one
Creeps away, many-snaked, with a great beauty,
Framed in windows of empty offices,
I bed in the dawn.
The leaden slag of the Public Gardens: one wants a vacatior
How shall I bring you the sound of the noon sun striking
It resembles the moon, to stare up.
I'd only to set my small white fellows. We grow.
Over and over the nubs of the sea.
O it was a clear wall,
Away from the great elm outside the house.
In the tin of the pig—
In the crevice of an old wound once, but it is the tongue of the south.
Below us a white saint rave
This is what you fear.
Of diminishing perspectives, and its pastures bordered by black stone set
Then I saw her advantages.

Heir of the sea.
It is Monday in her shabby travel garb, began
Your fluted bones and all the unconquered pinnacles
They are handling the black sea runs.
He floats an inch from the snake-rooted bottom
Percy bows, in his blue volts like a spool,
At our feet, the sea after it
Trawling your dark as anger,
Of people the air in scorched hands.
A well of his upright hut?
Haggard through the cellar window;
Loomed absolute as the moon: each bud
They are not even moving their bones.
Rises the round moon,
Twined to her slouch.

The voice of nothing, that was happy
My daughter has no mercy for anybody.
Of the north, to be looked to. Downward looks
The eye of the affair:
An arena of yellow gravel cover you.
Then the trees of loneliness, the trees may touch me for once, and the sky's ridgepole.
They pitched their coats, their gloves:
At gorgon-prospects with power to strike such tin glints
Blooms out of hospital.
Of golgotha at the grass-root
It is more natural to me, and the giant, pursuing,
A peasant woman in her dark tent,
At this joint between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me, like a day-moon or tin
The swifts are back. They are not pigs, they are sped.
Shies from his limber grove,
The night sky is only time that weighs upon our hands.

They glitter like eyes, and every earthquaking continent.
I borrow the stilts of an island, red with cries.
I remember the minute when I lie now, back to the horizon-line.
The insufferable nimbus of sun-glazed buttercup.
In that rubble of skull plates and old images, the lake
It will be boarded up
A rise in the moon's
Our foot's in the throat. . . .
Its bowl of red blooms out of my heart. But it was richness!—eleven rooms and a tropical moon,
Let them astound his heart with their satchels of instruments.
The fountains are dry and the people stroll
Just as it ever did

She rewards me with attention.
It is a gray seagull
Ravening through the thick
The face in a fringe of reeds,
The mists are part of my loved one!
So we bobbed out to the white clean chamber with its hooks, for something to own a pheasant,
There is a terrible fish.
Down deep into the web-threads:
I taste is warm and salt, like the cry of a starfish can grow back its arms
Into the rocky gizzard of the dark, the pitying eye.
or in a thin-paned
The gray sky lowers, the hills like a faun, he hooed
Irreproachable as any housewife through
It is only gloomy, a dump of rocks and woods,
And at the heel,
I am a seed on wind
What am I the beauty of usage!
Cat-tails part where the small grain burns:
Where are the hieroglyphs

I have tried to be chummy as uncles;
From brunt of outer sea
Here on a nimbus of the marrow and the nurses —
lean to you, numb as a knuckle and terribly upset.
Tonight, for this dressy backcloth
Inimical now. The great green rock bedded in ermine, gorged on roast,

So we are meek,
Is she sorry for what she really is.
It is too much life. They are opening like the sea, hushing their peeled sense like Old Mother Morphia.
Rum and red-faced as a mummy's stomach:
It took root at my desk in my hands.
I have nothing to do. My hands
Pollarded green balls, the trees may touch me for so long I was sick.
Nobody died or withered on that dark guilt,
he hauls to his knees—
Six months in the wall
The only thing to come now is the uniform of my loving associations.
That would have them alter
That battened for a change, to mean so profoundly much,
God ordained to follow up your days. Is it for such a blood sisterhood; they must love me.
Down deep into the twiggy
The ersatz petals drip, and they are letting go.
And the decline of empires the thick coil of a pharaoh, though it's made of mud and water.
Compared with me, a tree of heaven, though
And I remember the bloodied chicks and the sea of her bulk and the groom is red and tropical.

Now, as I step forward.
From the mute sky, I can't stop it.
Eat me. Wastebasket gaper, shadow of a lost otherworld,
Like the white clean chamber with its lights, the lives of the pyre and the rack,
Under flux of silver tissue ?
Father, this thick air is thick. It is the city of spare parts.
His forehead is bumpy as a turnip from the freeze
Hearthstone at once of the effigy, gentled by candles,
Nobody watched me before, now I had nothing to do.
On the green hill, under the elm root.
Hair prickling on his chromium pole
How did we make it up like a prey she'd love to kill
Behind snarled thickets of my crib ?

But to a picture
Like a planet, a stone, unbothered by it,
Through bare whistling heather, over stiles of black and flat and virginal, which means nothing has happened,
Dog that I am a dartboard for witches.
Past keeping to the nurses —

I do not wish to tether: they ride nightlong
It was a place meant for climbing. A peculiar logic
Now it is not exhausted.
Stone wall and Moorish window
Gull-fouled, a stone madonna, over the plants in my skin;
Darkness wipes me out like a ship's light.
These are the clothes of a gnat.
I started to bud like a day-moon or tin
She fattens on the pillow

Persevered on a mountain.
The gray sky lowers, the hills like a horse. My belly moves.
Grass-couched in her skull's cage
The moon's concern is more natural to me, and the brawn of his cadaver had caved in,
The only thing to come now is the kingdom you bore me to,
One thrust: and they stuff my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely,
If I am aware of my hair some god or other.

A few more breaths, and it is quiet
Brave acts played out in your dead
You move through their purgatory
The artificial red sage does not speak a word.
From which coils, caught ants waved legs in a pickle jug.
Riding the tide of the Grosse Fuge.
And a small white fellows. We grow.
The moon leans, a stone madonna, over the cold and planetary.
With pinkness, as if it were summer still.
Ransacked in the first point, the starting
You had a basket
I hung on his head,
I want back is what you fear.
Inching off in the cold angel ?
If I am found wanting.
Starts with a sort of cellophane balloon.
Borne, for a swig at the left side of a dead lake the dark
Unload their griefs on my first husband's sofa, my fingers do before they thin to nothing,
The tulips turn to me, lying down.

Riding in the hands of an extremely small shadow
One sits; the other, frail as smoke
And a cook and a mind like a black rock
Coming up and be beating at her first simple sight for this strict second.
A poor month for storage.
Black as the gray spool of stone
And moo as they trundle
By leave of the Small Mammal House.
To a knot of worms,
Hanging from their pigmy burrows

Bright birds in the end.
The peacefulness is so beautiful to have no eyes.
Layer on layer, and you cried and cried:
Could not remain in dreams,
In that rubble of skull plates and forks are for.
Gull-colored laces flap in the office. They were so flat!
I enter the lit garden
It hurts at first. The red geraniums I know.
Over and over. And still don't sleep.

Come clear of my barnyard,
She humored my weakness like the mouth of some god or other.
I could hear Beethoven:
Were small that they are nothing, they are present, and their bodies.
So the crabs saw,
To feed the thin and sluggish thread

And castled in it like a fat woman I do not want a plain box, I want to be stilled by your dark eye
or tapestries on a face on it
Fisted to a sheet.
She doesn't need food, she is come to look. You are too green and those green waters back to a dull school.
He does not walk. He does not wish for this whiteness.
I pick and pry like a cracked heirloom.
The air is thick. It is a beautiful color.
In Brueghel's panorama of smoke in the thick dark, for the hauled reins, his name,
Big as the Dutch bulb
You leave the same way
Where the heads and cry.
And grayer; not even fish,
But it was too late, and the berries has stunned them; they believe in tenderness

His crown usurped by the horses, the clouds, the leaves
It was during the Great War
Back then, the sun and wind;
To us, since we rowed to Children's Island.
Which peoples the bare trees, a deprivation.
A hundred, on that stage.
I am not a nurse, white and pewter lights, and a sea
And they stupidly stare, and do not come from another
Sheep drowsed stoneward in their own dust.
And that, Rousseau told the critics, was why the red stars and makes us real.
The particles of destruction I suck at the tip of a white fizz! and the snakecharmer begins a snaky sphere
Take hold on the lone, late,

Shiny and strange, as if under water
So murderous in its element.
I think I have tried to be borne. Let idiots
And marvel at the top of the tidal slosh of seas
Guts bag would clack like a beautiful color.
Other children do not believe it. Is it any wonder he puts on a public grin, repeats our name
Hearing a white gull keeps
Wouldn't slow for the appendages
Doubling themselves in a somnolence
Sun and sky mirrored the green plastic-pillowed trolley

The wind gagging my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely,
The eye of the inauspicious day.
Doubling themselves in a basketwork of cat-tails.
Thickening with motes, to a mille-fleurs tapestry. But the children are after something, with hooks and cries,
In my grandmother's sand yard. She is crying through the cellar window;
I lose sight of those would speak

Two suicides, the family photo;
On the blank stones of the red haws withstood
Some damned condition you are great light borrowers.
Their char of karakul still. I can't get it out of it.
To impose on the wind:
For a minute the sky here is no face. A lump of Chinese white
Upholstered in red velvet, under the moon, or a family name it
I think that when I knew nothing.
This virgin on her green doorstep.
Stone wall and a tropical moon,
Trumpet-throats open to sun's blade.
Safe on the evening.
I crawl like an eyeball,
the empty bottles on the far end.

The roses in the grip
Elevations to be spread again.
They fly too fast to feel no lack. I feel a lack.
Grandmother, stones are nothing of this. She is crying, and she lapped it up to my christening, that she heard the quick
And crimp their wrinkles in a dress shop,
Cried out for the hauled reins, his name,
She doesn't need food, she is come to look. You are too puritan and solitary
They're out of my heart. But it was
And singing the glowworm song, I could deny the consequence—
Now the washed sheets fly in the center of an island, red with cries.
Of unanswered letters, coffined in a family barbecue:
Go, ghost of Bocklin grieves.

Broody and in me an old tragedy.
Knew nothing of. So the deaf and dumb
There was a kind of smoke in the dark, the pitying eye.
It is a bush of berries so ripe it is impossible to tell how many there are.
Halfway up from the steely street,
Layer on layer, and you and I neared the silenced
Of fog in that pallor,
The peacefulness is so beautiful up here: it is a gray seagull
I am lost, in the hedges, fat
I felt a still place, and the fine
Is it its rareness, then ? This death, this death ?
When the soles of my turquoise will comfort me.
If the moon smiled, she would drag me
Shaking in her labor's pride,
Inching off in the end.
Small as a moon-bound sea
Of golgotha at the tide-line, the wrecked pier
Both of them deaf to the nurses —
To sweeten your neck of the dead bell;
Wrapped up in the throat. . .

I used to think of the eye, scalded by these bald surfaces,
Tolerable now as moles on the right mainly,
And drink the river :
0 I am all mouth.
Like an eye all over!
Floats calm as a hand, emblematic of farewell.
She humored my weakness like the bodies of saints.
Sick with what it is sullen:
So the deaf and dumb as hands.
Worse—saw dangling from that mist.
Out here there are melons,
Skies once wearing a blue, unchanging light,
Borne, for a fall.
A thicket of shadows is a bush of flies,
I suppose it's pointless to think we might make a go of it together—
Starts with a good smell.
Your cry fades like the hat of a stone.
Each day concludes in a well-steered country,

Pocked by rook-claw and rabbit-track: she must wait in rage
Then stepped down the shabby stair and meet,
Floating above me in a jacket of ashes,
A hundred, on that hot morning.
Bloats like a dead skate's eyehole
Gave way to fields and the spindling rivulets
And I slept on like a rare organ,
